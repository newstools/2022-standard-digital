Unions have threatened to strike after bandits shot dead a primary school teacher on Tuesday.  Simon Kirotich Cheserek, of Chesongoch Primary in Marakwet East was riding home on a motorbike when he was ambushed by assailants in Toroko, on the Chesongoch-Tot road.  The slain teacher was the husband of Mokoro chief Mrs Jaseline Kirotich. Elgeyo Marakwet Kuppet secretary Paul Biwott said the union was planning a strike if the attacks targeting them and near schools do not stop.
