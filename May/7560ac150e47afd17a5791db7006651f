A group that does not believe in the existence of God has condemned Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua for questioning Martha Karua’s religion and linking her to non-believers.  Atheists in Kenya (AIK) has denied claims that Karua was one of them.  “Every person has the right to manifest any religion through worship, practice, teaching or observance including observance of the day of worship,” said AIK leader Harrison Mumia.  During a Kenya Kwanza rally in Machakos, Mutua had posed: “Je mtakubali mtu mwenye haamini kuna Mungu aingie katika uongozi wa inchi yetu? (Will you allow a non-believer to lead our country?)”  But AIK said the Constitution recognises that every person has the right to freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion. “Such remarks are responsible for the stigma and discrimination that non-believers in Kenya face,” Mumia stated in a statement.  He added: “The Atheist in Kenya Society is duly registered and draws its membership from atheists, agnostics, and free thinkers.”    By Antony Gitonga | 1 hour ago By Mike Kihaki | 3 hours ago By Kamore Maina and Daniel Wesangula | 12 hours ago By Mactilda Mbenywe | 20 hours ago
