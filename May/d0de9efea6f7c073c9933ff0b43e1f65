[Jenipher Wachie, Standard]  One of the 46 independent presidential candidates Muthiora Kariara has unveiled a woman running mate ahead of the August 9 General Elections.  Muthiora said the decision to choose Mary Mutua was arrived at after vetting 11 candidates who had expressed interest.  ‘‘Based on research, we interviewed a couple of suitable and capable Kenyans and today we are proud to unveil to you a Daystar University alumnus, mother and someone who has vast experience in humanitarian sector, someone who I have known for a while and a new voice that represents every Kenyan outside there,’’ said Muthiora.  He said gender inclusivity was also a consideration to select Ms Mutua to give women a chance to lead. In 2017, Muthiora was an aspirant for the presidency but stepped down to be a running mate of Japheth Kavinga.      By Phares Mutembei | 8 hours ago By Phares Mutembei | 8 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 8 hours ago By Patrick Ntutu | 8 hours ago
