A further Sh27 million has been disbursed to recipients of the Nutrition Improvement through Cash and Health Education (NICHE) programme.  The government, through the Ministry of Public Service and Gender, said over one million beneficiaries of the Inua Jamii cash transfer programme will receive Sh8,000 each, as payment for two cycles.  “The cash transfer programme supports the most vulnerable members of the community by providing them with a stipend to cushion them from poverty, hunger and with the aim of improving their lives,” the Ministry said in a circular. The programme targets orphans and vulnerable children, senior citizens, and persons with severe disabilities.  At least 7,000 beneficiaries of the Inua Jamii project will receive Sh3,000 and Sh6,000 respectively, for two payment cycles.  3,400 others in the Hunger and Safety Net Programmme (HSNP) will each receive Sh2,000 and Sh4,000 respective for both cycles.
