Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i has declared a night curfew in Marsabit for the next 30 days.  This comes in the wake of last Thursday's banditry attack that left five people, including a Chief and an Assistant Chief, dead.  In a press briefing, Matiang’I revealed that the government will deploy security officers to the region to help restore normalcy in the area, as he put in place the night curfew.  He said the curfew will be effected on Monday, May 2 up to around Wednesday, June 1.  “We are not going there to be popular, we are going there to bring change. We have to bring the place to order. We have a team that will consistently update you on our progress in Marsabit,” CS Matiang’i said. Last week, Loglogo Senior Chief Kennedy Kongoman, Lokileleng'i Assistant Chief Keena Moga and the three other victims were in the pursuit of stolen cattle in the Awaye area when they were ambushed by unknown attackers.  Confirming the incident, Marsabit County Commissioner Paul Rotich said 12 other people, including Loglogo MCA Bernard Leakono, were also part of the team that was pursuing the cattle.  Citizen Digital reported the MCA went missing after the conflict.  However, Matiang’i says the MCA was found alive afterwards with four of his people critically injured.  He adds that they were rescued by police officers, adding they are currently undergoing treatment in hospital.  Moreover, Matiang’i confirmed that the previous conflict led to the loss of six lives.     By Lynn Kolongei and Edward Kosut | 19 minutes ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 27 minutes ago By Muriithi Mugo | 52 minutes ago By Julius Chepkwony | 1 hour ago
