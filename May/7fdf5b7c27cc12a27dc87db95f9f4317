Police officers are looking for a suspect who shot dead a man today, Monday afternoon, May 16, at Mirema Drive Estate in Kasarani Constituency.  The victim had just dropped off his passenger in one of the apartments in the estate when his vehicle was obstructed by that of an unknown person.  Kasarani OCPD Peter Mwanzo confirmed that the unknown person alighted from his vehicle, shot his target four times before he fled.  "We mobilised officers who went to the scene immediately after we got information that there had been a shooting in the area," Mwanzo said.  The police boss says details into the matter are still scanty. Detectives have since launched an investigation to establish what the motive of the killing was.  Body of the deceased has been taken to the city mortuary awaiting post mortem.  By Collins Kweyu | 2 days ago By Paul Ogemba | 5 days ago By Collins Kweyu | 5 days ago By Graham Kajilwa | 6 days ago
