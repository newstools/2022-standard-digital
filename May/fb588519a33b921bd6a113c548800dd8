NCCK General Secretary Canon Chris Kianyanjui (L) addresses members of the press at the Jumuiya centre in Limuru. [George Njunge, Standard]  National Council for Churches in Kenya (NCCK) has asked politicians to respect the freedom of all Kenyans and allow them freely participate in elections.  The commission further called on leaders to accept election results.  Rev Canon Kinyanjui, the NCCK general secretary, said politicians who will be dissatisfied with the outcome should seek redress in court.  “Kenyans and especially the youth should refuse to participate in mass actions or demonstrations regardless of the incitement before and during elections,” Kinyanjui said. Kinyanjui was speaking at Limuru Jumuiya Centre during a meeting by the clergy to reflect on possible scenarios before and during elections.    The meeting also discussed what is required to safeguard the nation's peace, cohesion, and integrity.  Kinyanjui noted that elections are the only channel for formation of government and that everyone has a right to participate in peaceful, free, credible and fair elections.  “We encourage Kenyans to visit the electoral commission offices or use electronic channels provided to verify their registration details. Participation in elections is a civic, religious and social responsibility that should be undertaken by all,” Kinyanjui said.  He said the president has a democratic right to support any political camp, but the president should exercise caution as he is a symbol of national unity.  The general secretary noted that the Church does not have a candidate of choice, "the Church's mandate ends at praying for the elections.
