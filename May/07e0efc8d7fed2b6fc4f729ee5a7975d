Police have identified the man who was fatally shot at Mirema, Kasarani Sub-County in Nairobi on Monday as 40-year-old Samuel Mugota.  Mugota had reportedly dropped a friend at Mirema Drive, when his assailant, who was trailing him in another vehicle, shot him six times at close range.  The victim, who was on the driver’s seat of his Honda CRV, died on the spot. His attacker, thereafter, sped off.  Police are probing an alleged land deal as the possible motive for Mugota’s murder.   The 40-year-old has been identified as a resident of Kasarani, and a father of three children.  Authorities said they found seven different national identity cards in his car.  His family members, who were present during the autopsy at City Mortuary today, got a permit to move his body to the Kenyatta University Funeral Home.  None of his family members agreed to speak with the media.  The postmortem conducted on Mugota confirmed that he died of gunshot wounds.  Vincent Kipkorir, the Kasarani Directorate of Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO), told The Standard that investigations into Mugota’s death have commenced, with police seeking eyewitnesses’ accounts and CCTV recordings to unravel the murder.
