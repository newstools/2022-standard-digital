Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya has moved to calm voters and leaders in Meru County, as calls for his election as Raila Odinga’s running mate grew.  The minister addressed crowds in various towns and farmers at factories where both elected and aspiring leaders piled the pressure that he should be picked as Raila’s running mate, due to his development record in the ministry, and his political clout in the region. Leading the calls that Munya should be made running mate were EALA MP Mpuru Aburi and aspirants in the Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Alliance affiliate parties.  Even as Munya told the people that Raila had won over a significant portion of voters in the Mt Kenya region but urging residents to make him President, they said they would do so but Munya should be picked as running mate. Mr Aburi who was first elected on an ODM ticket, affirmed his own support for a Raila presidency but said they also expected the CS to be made Raila’s number two.  Aburi said the region was happy that Munya was shortlisted as potential running mate for the former PM, and that he deserved to get it owing to his impact on the welfare of farmers in all parts of Kenya.  “Munya has crisscrossed all parts of the country revolutionizing agriculture. Time has come for Meru to fly the (deputy president) flag,” said Aburi. Aburi who will seek to recapture the Tigania East parliamentary seat on his National Ordinary People Empowerment Union, said: “We want Raila as president and Munya as his deputy.”  But Munya urged for calm, only assuring them he would be “very close” to Raila, who he said deserved the top seat.
