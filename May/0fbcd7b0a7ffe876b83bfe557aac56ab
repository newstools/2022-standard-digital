Lawrence Murimi yesterday when he showed up at Kangaru School with a cockerel gifted by his uncle after circumcision. He hoped to use it as school fees. [Muriithi Mugo, Standard]  A student from Embu County left many people astonished when he walked to Kangaru School, which is about three kilometres from his home, carrying a cockerel as school fees.  Lawrence Murimi, 16, was admitted to the school after scoring 313 marks in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) but never reported on April 4 when other students reported.  He said his mother, who is a casual labourer, could not afford the Sh17,000 required by the school for the first term.  Murimi said he could not stay at home while other students were in school. "I took the cock I was gifted by my uncle after circumcision with the hope that I would be admitted to my dream school," he said. Before getting to school, Murimi, who was accompanied by his mother Pauline Mukami, sought assistance from the county commissioner's office who was not in.  Jamleck Muturi, the chairperson of the Teachers Service Commission, pledged to cater for the boy's upkeep for the next four years.  Kangaru School chief principal Solomon Koech, who led a team of well-wishers and education officials to the boy's home in Majengo slums in Embu, said the school had received more than five boys who needed help.
