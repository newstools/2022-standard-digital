A shoplifter who was rescued by former governor Mike Sonko has committed the same offence again.  Alvin Linus Chivondo was arrested on Thursday night at Naivas Supermarket along Ronald Ngala Street on suspicion of stealing maize flour from the supermarket.  In a separate incident on April 15, the man had been arraigned in court for stealing goods worth Sh3,165 from a supermarket.  Chivondo appeared before Milimani Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo and admitted to two counts of stealing and handling stolen goods worth Sh3,165, the property of Naivas Kenya limited.  The facts as read in court indicated that Chivondo had again on April 3, at the same supermarket, been found to have stolen goods. He was taken to Central police station and was pardoned by the Officer Commanding Station (OCS). However, on Thursday, Chivondo was once again caught trying to steal maize flour. The suspect was taken to Central Police Station and is likely to be charged in court after police complete investigations.  Central OCPD David Baariu confirmed to The Standard that Chivondo was at the station and he may be arraigned in court to answer to charges of stealing.
