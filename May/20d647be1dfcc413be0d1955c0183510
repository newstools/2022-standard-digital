[Denish Ochieng, Standard]  Former radio presenter Sella Ayimba has thrown her hat in the ring for the Siaya Woman Representative’s seat.  Ayimba, who until last month worked at Nam Lolwe FM, will face off with two other contenders in a bid to unseat Dr Christine Ombaka, who is defending the seat on ODM ticket.  Elected in both 2013 and 2017 elections, Ombaka became one of the two women to retain their Woman Representative seats in Nyanza in 2017 elections, alongside Homa Bay’s Gladys Wanga.  Ayimba, the Sinaga Girls High School alumnus, who will be vying on Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG), says she is the best bet for the seat. Ayimba, who recently launched her campaigns, said despite having resources, the current leadership has not met the expectations of the voters.  “Being a journalist, I got an opportunity to interact with many people and I understand the plight of the voters,” she said.
