Muslims across the country have converged in various locations across the country to mark the Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations.  During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims all over the world enjoy Eid ul-Fitr, which is a celebration of breaking their fast after a month of fasting from dawn to sunset.   Eid is an Arabic term which means "festival of breaking of the fast". It is the most important religious festival in Islam Calendar and takes place in the month of Shawwal.  Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho and other leaders led the Muslim faithful during an early morning prayer session at Roald Ngala school in Mombasa County.  Ramadan is a special month which commemorates the first revelation given to the Prophet Muhammad. It is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and only begins when the new moon is sighted. It can also vary by one day from country to country if the new moon is sighted in one country but not yet in another.  The Islamic calendar is based on lunar cycles, not the Gregorian calendar, which is why the exact date of Ramadan changes each year.  As the charity, Muslim Aid says: "The Islamic calendar follows the phases of the moon, commonly known as the lunar cycle.  It is believed that the Quran - the Islamic holy book - was revealed to mankind during Ramadan through the Prophet Muhammad.  During the sacred month, Muslims are able to fast abstain from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations from dawn until sunset.  They also try to avoid other sinful acts, including gossip and swearing.
