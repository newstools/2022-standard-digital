Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi with DAP-K aspirants when they rejected the zoning proposal. [Bernard Lusigi, Standard]  Democratic Action Party of Kenya candidates in Busia have criticised the idea of zoning in the county.  The candidates for governor, senator, MP, Woman Representative and MCA from seven sub-counties said the proposed approach favours ODM.  Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi is eyeing the governor seat. He stated that candidates who met in Busia town said they will back ODM leader Raila Odinga's bid but not the zoning idea.  Mr Mulomi questioned why some leaders are pushing for the zoning idea despite earlier clarification by DAP-K leader Wafula Wamunyinyi that they will not agree to the arrangement. "We need clarification and assurance from the Azimio secretariat because DAP-K candidates and their supporters are in the dark. We must allow democracy to prevail by letting candidates face off in the election," the deputy governor said.  The meeting brought together 30 aspirants led by Mr Mulomi, Evalyne Ikwii (Woman Representative aspirant) and MP aspirants Dr Isaac Omeri (Nambale), John Makokha (Matayos), Lawi Mamai (Teso North), and Norbert Wangalwa (Butula) as well as MCA aspirants.  Ms Ikwii said Azimio-allied parties should focus on getting votes for Mr Odinga and shun disagreements that could scuttle the former Prime Minister's chances of garnering majority votes in Western.  "Zoning will undermine democracy."     By Winfrey Owino | 1 hour ago By Jacob Ng’etich | 1 hour ago By Stephen Rutto and Obare Osinde | 1 hour ago By Brian Otieno | 1 hour ago
