Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka addresses residents of Mlolongo area in Athi River where he started his tour to Mombasa on road. [Peterson Githaiga, Standard]  Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday insisted that he would not attend interviews for Azimio la Umoja One Kenya running mate.  Speaking in Mlolongo town, Kalonzo said being subjected to an interview in order to be Raila Odinga's running mate is like mocking him.  "I respect the Azimio Council led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and which I'm a member of, but I don't think I can go that low to be interviewed to become Raila's deputy, having been the second in command in this country before," he said.  Azimio Council appointed a seven-member advisory panel to pick a running mate for Raila. The panelists are expected to identify and submit the name of a potential running mate by May 10.  "Although I don't want to be seen like I'm undermining the coalition, I want one of the people attending the interviews to stand and tell Kenyans that he or she was ready to be the president of this country, but decided to step down for Raila Odinga," he said.  He added: "That is why I'm saying in capital letters that I will not attend the interview or sit before that panel. I should be an obvious choice for the position." Kalonzo was accompanied by Mavoko MP Patrick Makau, former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, Wiper nominee for Machakos governor Wavinya Ndeti, Kathiani MP Robert Mbui, among others.
