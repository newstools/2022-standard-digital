Deputy President Dr William Ruto yesterday returned to Uasin Gishu to consolidate his home turf, five months after he was endorsed as presidential candidate.   Dr Ruto attended a service at PCEA Langas, before addressing two rallies in Kapseret Constituency.  He called on his home county to rally behind him to win the August 9 presidential election.     The Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate last addressed a rally at the Eldoret Sports Club on January 8, and was blessed and released to seek support from other counties. Yesterday, the DP told the cosmopolitan Eldoret to remain peaceful and cohesive, and set an example to the counties. He endorsed UDA candidates to run against local leaders opposed to his bottom-up economic model. He endorsed former Uasin Gishu Finance executive Mr Julius Rutto to oust Kesses MP Mr Swarup Mishra, an independent candidate who has been the DP’s critic.   Dr Ruto also asked Nandi Hills Constituency residents to replace Mr Alfred Keter, who joined UDA this year but lost the party’s ticket before going independent, with his arch rival Mr Bernard Kitur.   He urged Uasin Gishu leaders to build unity in his home county before, during and after the elections.   “We started the journey of uniting with Uhuru Kenyatta and today, tribalism is no longer a big challenge in the country,” he said.   Dr Ruto said Uasin Gishu would be at the centre of national government planning, like other counties, if he succeeds Mr Kenyatta in August.   “...this is the home of the DP and the next President. I want all of us to demonstrate unity and be an example to the whole country,” he said.
