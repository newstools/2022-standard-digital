To all our Muslim brothers and sisters,  As we mark the end of the Holy Month of Ramadhan today, it gives me great pleasure to send you this message of goodwill and best wishes as you celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr.  Eid-ul- Fitr is a time to rejoice in having fulfilled the command of Allah (the most Merciful and Gracious). It is also a time to share with the less fortunate in keeping with the teachings of the Holy Quran and Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). Even though the Holy Month of Ramadhan has come to an end, I urge all Muslims to keep praying for the country as we head towards elections.  Let us remember we are one people and continue to encourage one another to contribute to peace and unity amongst us. This will ultimately ensure our country remains the great nation that we are all proud of.  May Allah, the most Merciful and Gracious, grant you peace, health and joy on this day.
