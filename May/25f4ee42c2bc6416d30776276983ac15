The Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK) Meru Show will resume next month after a two-year break due to Covid-19.  ASK CEO Batram Muthoka said the event will be held at its traditional venue at Gitoro near Meru town and will be held for four days from June 1.  This comes as the ASK begins partial resumption of the agricultural events which are popular with farmers, students, children and other participants across the country.  “We have been out of the exhibitions for the last two years because of Covid-19. This year we are running nine shows out of the 16, Meru being one of them. We have done the Eldoret show, Meru will be second," said Muthoka.  Muthoka said they anticipate a bigger number of participants at the Meru show.  "We have already invited neighbouring counties of Embu, Isiolo, Tharaka Nithi, Laikipia and others," he said.  According to Muthoka, the show whose theme is “Promoting innovation and technology in Agriculture and trade” is expected to attract up to 350,000 participants, including farmers and entrepreneurs.  Meru branch chairman Stanley Maingi said agriculture and trade will feature prominently at the extravaganza.  Adults will pay Sh250 while children will pay Sh200 at the entrance.
