Kenyans will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for fuel after the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) announced that the commodity has risen by Sh5.50.  In Nairobi, a litre of Petrol will go for Sh150.12, Diesel (Sh131) and Kerosene (Sh118.94).  EPRA in a statement released on Saturday, May 14 said that the prices increased because the average landed cost of the fuel also went up. The new prices are in place for the next 30 days and changes either upwards or downwards or remaining the same will be announced on June 14, 2022.  EPRA says the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) by the government has cushioned Kenyans despite the Sh5.50 rise. In its statements it says if PDL was not in place then Kenyans would have paid Sh176.47 for Petrol, Sh174.94 for Diesel and Sh169.26 for Kerosene.  Petrol import price in April, EPRA said, increased by 1.56 per cent; diesel 6.49 per cent and kerosene 31.13 per cent. In Nakuru, a litre of petrol will sell at Sh149.64; diesel (Sh130.83); kerosene Sh118.79.  In Eldoret, a litre of petrol will retail at Sh150.53; diesel (Sh131.72) and kerosene (Sh119.67).  In Kisumu, a litre of petrol will go for Sh150.53; diesel (Sh131.70) and kerosene (Sh119.66).  In Mombasa, a litre of petrol will be sold at Sh147.86; diesel (Sh128.76) and kerosene (Sh116.69).  In Kisii, a litre of petrol will retail at Sh151.41; diesel (Sh132.58) and kerosene (Sh120.55).
