The roof of Old Town Hall in Nakuru caved in on Friday. [Courtesy]  The county government will start the rehabilitation of the historic Old Town Hall built in 1945 immediately.  The building's roof collapsed on Friday. Nobody was injured during the incident.  “The building is very old, dating back to colonial days,” said Gitau Thabanja, the Nakuru City manager.  Thabanja noted that the building has been gazetted as a historical site. He said the building has been closed for public use to allow renovation to preserve its heritage.  “The Nakuru City Board has budgeted for the renovation that will commence with immediate effect. We are committed to the preservation and restoration of our heritage,” he said.  Former Nakuru Mayor Kimunya Kamana, 93, said the hall is rich in history. The hall was used by the First President, the late Jomo Kenyatta to sign a treaty with British Colonialists.  “He assured the colonialists that no one would touch them and urged them not to be fearful because they will be allowed to live in the country,” said Kamana.
