Raila Odinga’s running Martha Karua says war on graft will be top of the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential agenda.  The NARC-Kenya Party leader said she’ll encourage lobby groups to speak up should they spot graft in government that requires the Executive’s attention.  Karua said this would allow the civil society to help the government come up with policies that improve the welfare of the Kenyan people.  The deputy presidential candidate spoke at Serena Hotel in Nairobi on Friday, May 27, when she met Okoa Uchumi and Angaza civil groups.  “I want to say I am glad to work with you (the civil society). There is a prospect and partnership of working together because our country is our responsibility,” said Karua. “No human being is perfect. The moment you let us veer off the road, we may go off in a way that we may never come back together. So, whether we smile or not, it is your duty [to ensure that you pile pressure on the government to give efficient services to the people].”  The civil groups pledged to work with the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya outfit to “liberate Kenyans from the shackles of poor leadership and graft”.  Karua further said that should Raila Odinga win the presidency, she will ensure that the Azimio administration makes prudent use of the taxpayers’ money.  “Debt is not necessarily bad. [It is prudent when] a government uses the funds to open up the economy and generate revenue. A government is not different from a business [organisation]. So, borrowing and spending must be prudent.  “When you do things the way they are not supposed to be done, you are at war with your country,” she stated.
