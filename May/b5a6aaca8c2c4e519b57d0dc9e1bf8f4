The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal has stopped National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi from signing a coalition agreement with Deputy President William Ruto's Kenya Kwanza Alliance.  The order was issued on Thursday following a petition by Democratic Party officials.  "A temporary injunction restraining the respondents from further discussing, ratifying, perpetuating or in any other way promoting the purported coalition agreement with the 3rd Interested party," tribunal members Samuel Nderitu and Adelaide Mbithi ordered.  "A temporary injunction restraining the 1st Interested Party from registering any document purporting to be a coalition agreement with the Democratic Party as one of the signatories," they added.  The party officials are also threatening to eject Muturi from his position as DP party leader, saying that he does not follow the criteria stipulated in the party’s constitution. Led by director of elections, D. K. Munene, party officials said that during the party’s National Delegates Conference (NDC) held on February 20, they resolved not to support or join any coalition before August 9.  Munene accused said Muturi's move to join and support Kenya Kwanza is a personal decision and not a party’s stand.  ‘‘We are happy with the orders issued by the tribunal since they confirmed what we have always been saying, Muturi has no authority to take the party to Kenya Kwanza," he said.  "If any of the officials wants to join the coalition, let them do so in their individual capacity,’’ he added.
