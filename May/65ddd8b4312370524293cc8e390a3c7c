More than 300 cows have been stolen in the county since December last year.  Governor Okoth Obado has urged the security agencies to bring the culprits to book. Mr Obado, who asked residents to report suspects, commended the Directorate of Veterinary Services for rescuing some of the injured animals.  On Monday, the governor gave out 139 in-calf dairy cows and 93 Sahiwal bulls worth Sh24.4 million to farmers.  It is estimated that the programme, which started in the year 2014/2015, has reduced the county's milk deficit by close to 10 per cent per year.  Data from the Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Department shows that the county produces an average of 25 million litres of milk annually against the demand of 88 million litres. It imports at least 10 per cent from Tanzania and the rest from Narok, Nandi and Homa Bay counties.  Governor Obado urged farmers to ensure the cows are well taken care of for good productivity.  Farmers from Kuria East, Kuria West, Suna West, Suna East, Uriri, Awendo and Rongo have so far benefited.     By Olivia Odhiambo | 8 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 8 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 1 day ago By Lynn Kolongei | 1 day ago
