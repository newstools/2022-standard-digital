Makueni MP Dan Maanzo has added his voice to calls for Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to reconsider his ambitions to run for the presidency in the forthcoming polls.  Maanzo says they will have a consultative meeting with their party leader once he returns from his overseas trip and expressed his optimism that their plea to have him rejoin Azimio la Umoja One Kenya will be heard.  Speaking during an interview (Siasa Fiesta) on KTN News Tuesday morning, Maanzo reiterated that the Wiper leader was not in any way planning to team up with Deputy President William Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza as has been the rumoured.  “The possibility of going it alone is diminishing and Kalonzo is an honest man who believes in the best for the country. There has been a lot of consultations both with Wiper aspirants and supporters and we are looking forward to his return”, he said.  Maanzo also stated that once Kalonzo returns to the country, they will be discussing the issue of the legality of the Chief Cabinet Secretary adding that there are modifications which can be made to make it legal. According to the law, one has to be a Cabinet Secretary before they become a Chief Cabinet Secretary. Yesterday, Wiper hosted its aspirants at a hotel in Machakos County, where 45 out of 50 voted for Kalonzo to return to Azimio.  “Moving forward where Kalonzo Musyoka stand is where the next government will be. I want to assure you that we can’t work with Kenya Kwanza or Kenya Kwisha,” Wiper’s Organizing Secretary Robert Mbui told a news conference after the consultative meeting on Monday.  That happened as Musyoka sent his running mate Andrew Sunkuli to represent him at a meeting IEBC officials held with presidential aspirants at the Bomas of Kenya.
