Eight mourners died on Friday night after a van they were travelling in was involved in an accident along the Mai Mahiu-Narok Highway.  The five women and three men were returning to Naivasha from Kisii County when their mini-bus rammed head-on into a lorry near Mafuta Taa centre.  The eight are believed to be flower farm workers who were on their way back from the burial before the 2 am accident occurred.  Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident adding that four others were seriously injured.  He said that seven of the victims died on the spot while one passed on while undergoing treatment. "We have lost eight people after the mini-bus driver veered off his lane and rammed into a lorry heading in the opposite direction," he said.
