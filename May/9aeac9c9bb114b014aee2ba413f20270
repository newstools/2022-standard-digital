Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has rubbished the candidature of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who seeks to succeed him on a Wiper ticket.  Speaking after attending Eid-ul-Fitr prayers yesterday, Mr Joho said Mombasa was not a dumping ground, and criticised Wiper for granting Mr Sonko a direct ticket to contest for the seat.  He reiterated that ODM had decided to back Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and they were ready to retain the seat.  “We want a leader who can easily unite the people of Mombasa and do even better than the current administration, which I lead. That person is Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir,” said the ODM deputy leader.  He said Mombasa was in safer hands with Mr Nassir.   Mombasa County Assembly Speaker Aharub Khatri said Mombasa had never been a place for political rejects who had been hounded out of office elsewhere.  Apart from Mr Sonko, Mr Nassir also faces former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar (United Democratic Alliance), Deputy Governor William Kingi (Pamoja African Alliance) and former Nyali MP Awiti Bolo of Vibrant Democratic Party.  Mr Nassir said those thinking that Mombasa voters are up for sale are day-dreaming.  “Let them stop such wishful thinking. We will go full throttle to ensure ODM retains all elective seats in Mombasa County,” he said.  The legislator said Mombasa leaders are united to block anyone from elsewhere from taking up the county’s leadership.  pmwakio@standardmedia.co.ke      By Willis Oketch | 1 hour ago By Patrick Beja | 11 hours ago By Bernard Sanga | 1 day ago By Joackim Bwana | 5 days ago
