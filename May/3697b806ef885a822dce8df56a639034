The Sh400m Naivasha wholesale market will be completed in two months.  The facility constructed by the county government will benefit more than 1,000 traders.  The market, now in the second and final phase, is expected to reduce wastage by more than 80 per cent by providing cold stores for traders.  Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui said 20 markets are being constructed across the county as a way of supporting farmers and traders.  “This is part of efforts to uplifting traders who work under difficult circumstances,” he said. Speaking at the facility, Kinyanjui said for years, farmers had suffered due to a lack of market. “We had massive wastage due to poor storage,” he said. Naivasha Municipal Board official Peninnah Muigai said the old market accommodated 400 traders but the number would rise to 1,000.
