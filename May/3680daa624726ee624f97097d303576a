Uhuru Highway, one carriageway on Lang’ata Road, Moi Avenue, Bunyala and Mombasa roads are some of the routes that will be affected tomorrow (Sunday, May 8) as Kenya hosts the Nairobi City Marathon.  One section of Lang’ata Road (on the Nyayo Stadium side) will be closed until Monday 6am.  Between midnight and Sunday 5pm, Douglas Wakiihuri Road will be closed. Uhuru Highway, on the other hand, will be closed between midnight and 2pm.  The intersection of Mombasa Road towards Likoni Road will be closed between midnight and 10am.  Other roads that will experience traffic disruption between midnight and 3pm Sunday are Haile Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, City Hall Way, Taifa Road, Parliament Road, Mama Ngina Street, Kimathi Street, Kenyatta Avenue, Koinange Street, Monrovia Street, Muindi Mbingu Street, University Way, Simba Street, Globe Roundabout, Kipande Road, Museum Hill Road, Bunyala Road and Masaba Road. “Motorists are advised to avoid the closed sections of the roads and follow available alternative roads as will be directed by traffic police officers on the ground,” said Engineer Kungu Ndungu, the Director-General of the Kenya National Highways Authority.  “The marathon route runs through various roads including the Nairobi Expressway,” he said.  The Nairobi City Marathon is an annual running competition over the marathon distance usually in Kenya’s capital.  It was first held in 2003. The competition has since expanded to include a half marathon race along with the main race.  In 2019, some 544 participants participated in the race, which was an increase from the previous year’s 499.
