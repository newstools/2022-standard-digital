The Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) Party has lauded ODM leader Raila Odinga for nominating Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua as his running mate.  MDG termed the move as a milestone in Kenyan political history saying such an appointment shows Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Alliance adheres to the two-thirds gender rule.  The party said the nomination was a great honour to women in Kenya who have been side-lined in leadership positions.    Ugenya MP David Ochieng who is also the MDG party leader said that the dawn of the third liberation in the country has come. "I take this opportunity to congratulate former Prime Minister Raila Amollo Odinga for yet another milestone in Kenyan politics after appointing Martha Karua as his running mate as per the Constitution of Kenya. We at the Movement for Democracy and Growth Party wish to heartily congratulate the Hon. Martha Karua for a well-deserved appointment," said Ochieng.  The Ugenya legislator challenged women to stand up and vie for elective positions rather than waiting to be nominated.  "Our women are pillars of society and need to be empowered. Today women in Kenya are a happy lot after one of them was nominated to be the second in command. It's a big day for our party and our aspirants and we wish them the best of luck," he stated.  Ochieng appealed to their supporters to turn up and vote for Raila and Karua in large numbers.  "We believe that with the Azimio-One Kenya Alliance presidential ticket now complete, we are poised for vibrant campaigns and confident that we shall form the next government after August 9, 2022, General Elections," he said.  The MP at the same time called on all Azimio -One Kenya Alliance coalition partners to accept the nomination and rally behind Raila and his deputy.
