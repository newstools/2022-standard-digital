Operations at the county government of Mandera could ground to a halt after the High Court issued an order freezing its accounts.  Justice Abida Ali-Aroni issued the order stopping the county government and governor Ali Roba from withdrawing, transferring or dealing with money held in the county government accounts. This is after a resident went to court claiming that the Roba administration had misappropriated Sh340 million.  “The Controller of Budget is also restrained from approving or disbursing funds from the Central Bank of Kenya or any monies held in the county government of Mandera accounts pending determination of the suit,” ruled Aroni.  The petitioner, Isamil Abdullahi Abdirahman had through lawyer Eric Kinaro claimed Governor Roba and county chief executive for Finance had colluded with County Assembly to pass a Supplementary Budget as a means of looting public funds.  Abdirahman said Supplementary Budget passed by the assembly on February 14 had budgeted for some projects being undertaken by the national government while leaving out projects which affect the residents. “Under the Supplementary Budget, an estimated Sh336 million has been allocated to some ghost projects which have not been accounted for while some areas have been marginalised without a single penny being allocated to them,” said Kinaro.  He stated that the people of Mandera will suffer untold prejudice because their funds will be misappropriated and embezzled through illegal schemes.   pogemba@standardmedia.co.ke       By Michael Saitoti | 9 hours ago By Abdiaziz Roble | 12 days ago By Allan Mungai | 23 days ago By Allan Mungai | 25 days ago
