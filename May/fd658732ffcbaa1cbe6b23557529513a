Deputy President William Ruto yesterday promised to form an all-inclusive government which will take care of interests and aspirations of all Kenyans.  Ruto, the United Democratic Alliance presidential candidate and his allies in Kenya Kwanza coalition, promised to address historical land injustices at the Coast.  While drumming up support for the bottom-up economic model, he promised to prioritise provision of water for domestic agricultural use, housing and revival of the stalled projects.  Ruto was addressing a meeting, dubbed Taita Taveta Economic Forum, in Mwatate. They discussed several issues touching on mining, agriculture, ranching, the youth, boda boda and small scale traders.  He said his administration will complete the Sh30 billion Mzima Springs Phase Two pipeline to benefit the local community before the project is rolled out to other coastal counties. The first phase of Mzima Springs Water Project situated in Taita Taveta was constructed in 1957.   “The Mzima Two projects stalled due to bad politics. Procurement for the second Mzima Two pipeline is done. Within 100 days, we will complete the project,” Ruto told the meeting.  Other projects he promised to build include the Taveta-Challa-Ilasit-Rombo, Bura-Mgange-Wundanyi-Mbale-Mto-wa-Mwagodi, Maungu-Kasigau and Voi-Sagala roads and Voi-Mwatate-Taveta railway line.  “We want a country where all of us can celebrate where we are. And we want to form the next government with all your priorities and interests anchored in the charter that I will soon sign with you,” Ruto said.  He was accompanied by governor’s Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Dr Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Women Rep Lydia Haika, former Governor John Mruttu and other aspirants.
