Patients visiting hospitals in Kisii and Homa Bay counties for elective procedures are being turned away after doctors cancelled the bookings to demand their salaries.  Grievances of the 240 doctors were addressed in a letter to Public Service heads in the counties through the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU).  “Failure to meet this demand, we regrettably inform you that all the clinics and elective services shall be disrupted effective May 10,” read the letter signed by Nyanza union secretary, Aggrey Nyabuti.  The return to work formula signed between the two county governments and the healthcare workers states that payments must be effected by the 5th day of every month.  KMPDU Nyanza chairman Onyango Ndong’a said: “We are on a go-slow until our employers meet our demands.”  In Kisii, County Secretary Patrick Lumumba insisted “we have paid them and they ought to resume work.”  Homa Bay Health Executive Richard Muga acknowledged that April's salaries were delayed. “However, we do not have any arrears,” Muga added.   By Olivia Odhiambo | 5 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 7 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 3 days ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 3 days ago
