Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential candidate Raila Odinga with former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth in Kiambu, on Tuesday. [David Njaaga, Standard]  The search for Raila’s deputy continues to gain momentum, even as the deadline closes.  Jubilee Party has forwarded the names of Peter Kenneth and Sabina Chege to the Committee of Eminent Persons, that is tasked with finding a suitable candidate for the position of running mate in the Azimio La Umoja – One Kenya.  This is through a statement dated 5th May 2022, by the party’s National Elections Board Chairperson Stephen Wandeto.  “We refer to the above subject matter and forward herewith names of persons proposed by Jubilee Party for consideration as the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition Deputy President Nominees. I) Hon. Peter Kenneth II) Hon. Sabina Chege.” Said Wandeto. The suggestion by Jubilee Party comes hours after a section of party leaders pleaded with Raila to pick Peter Kenneth.  Peter Kenneth who was born on 27th November 1965 joined politics in December 2002, when he was first elected Member of Parliament for Gatanga Constituency, a position he held until 2013. He has served as Assistant Minister and even threw his hat in the ring for the position of President during the 2013 general election.  Sabina Wanjiru Chege on the other hand is Woman Representative for Murang’a County. She has held the position since 2013 when she was elected with 96.6% of the vote. Just last month, she withdrew her gubernatorial bid for Murang’a County saying she will instead focus her energies in pushing for Raila Odinga’s victory in the upcoming polls.  The Azimio la Umoja selection panel on Wednesday said it will only consider candidates who are members of the coalition.        By Kamore Maina | 3 hours ago By Graham Kajilwa | 3 hours ago By Graham Kajilwa | 5 hours ago By Peter Theuri | 11 hours ago
