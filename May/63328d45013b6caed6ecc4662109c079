A businessman and political aspirant George Owino from Ugenya in Siaya County has gone missing.  Mr Owino is said to have been abducted on May 4, 2022 in Ugunja between 7.30pm and 8pm according to his family members and the police.  Mr Owino had expressed interest to run for West Ugenya ward seat through a Movement for Growth and Democracy (MDG) ticket and had already started campaigning.  Yesterday, County Commander Michael Muchiri confirmed that the family had reported the politician’s disappearance.  Mr Muchiri said the matter was with the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) who had already started off investigations. According to his second wife Martha Ndenda, he left their Ugenya home on Wednesday morning for Siaya town but did not disclose what he was going to do there.  “He just said he would be passing through the bank. There was not much communication between us during the day,” she said.  By Antony Gitonga | 8 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 8 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 1 day ago By Lynn Kolongei | 1 day ago
