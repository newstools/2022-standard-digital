Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha. [Mose Sammy, Standard]  Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha yesterday made several notable directives to secondary school heads.  He ordered them to not to turn away students due to lack of school uniforms; that they should admit any students with uniform resembling their school’s.  Secondly, the CS cautioned schools against making unreasonable financial  demands on parents. Thirdly, he directed teachers not to send children home because of fees.  These directives show that Prof Magoha not only has the interest of  children at heart, but also understands that many parents and guardians are financially strained due to the hard economic times. We commend him for that. But we also urge him to ensure the government provides requisite funding to schools to ensure they continue to operate normally.
