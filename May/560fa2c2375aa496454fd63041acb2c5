A driver transporting muguka died on Monday in Embu County after his car collided head-on with a matatu.  According to eyewitnesses, the car was being driven at high speed and on the wrong side of the road.  This is a familiar story. Miraa Khat and muguka transporters drive recklessly every day, putting their lives and those of other road users in danger. Yet despite this obvious disregard for the law and human life, police are largely unbothered by this despicable behaviour.  If they have no secret pact with the khat drivers and owners, police must treat them like any other motorists and ensure that they respect the road rules.  They must be taught a lesson so that they stop thinking that miraa is more important than human life.
