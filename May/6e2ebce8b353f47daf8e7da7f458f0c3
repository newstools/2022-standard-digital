[Godfrey Oundoh, Standard]  Former Labour Administrative Secretary Patrick Ntutu has picked 30-year-old civil engineer as his running mate in the Narok governorship race.  The UDA aspirant yesterday said the choice of Mathew Kipkorir was deliberate to ensure ethnic balance and also involve the youth in the management of the county.  Mr Ntutu said he was ready to face his opponents, including ODM’s Moitalel ol Kenta, who is the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition flag bearer.  Mr Kipkorir promised to stand deliver on behalf of the youth, thanking the Kenya Kwanza Alliance for picking him. The former student of the Kabianga High School in Kericho studied civil engineering at the Kenyatta University and is in private practice.  Also present at the event were the wife of the late Vice President George Saitoti bodyguard Rebecca Tonkei, Emurua Dikirr MP Joana Ng’eno and Governor Samuel Tunai.  The leaders thanked the party for considering ethnic and clan balance in picking aspirants, saying this will play a major role in ensuring service delivery for all.
