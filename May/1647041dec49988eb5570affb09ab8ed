A court has ordered a Kenya Defence Forces soldier to buy school books for his children by Tuesday.  The soldier was sued by his estranged wife in 2012 for the upkeep of the three minors.  In 2013, Acting Senior Resident Magistrate Derrick Kuto ordered that the complainant be given Sh20,000 per month for the months he was away serving in a peace mission in Somalia.  The court also directed the man to pay school fees and related expenses, including Sh10,000 monthly rent.  The woman also asked the court to compel the defendant’s employer to ensure that the three children receive medical treatment in their facilities. The magistrate also directed that upon the defendant’s return, the pending issues be determined in court.  On June 22, 2018, Senior Principal Magistrate TB Nyangena ordered that the Kenya Air Force man be given access to his three children during school holidays.  He also ordered that the military man provides for his children as per the 2013 directives.  The Tuesday order came after the woman went back to court, this time complaining that the children risk being sent away from school due to lack of books. The children are Class Eight, Class Seven and Four.   By Paul Ogemba | 12 hours ago By Graham Kajilwa | 1 day ago By Paul Ogemba | 1 day ago By Jacob Ngetich | 3 days ago
