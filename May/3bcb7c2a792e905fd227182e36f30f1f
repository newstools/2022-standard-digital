Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has been crowned as the Pokomo community kingpin.  Godhana will seek to defend his seat on ODM ticket in the upcoming general election.  The crowning took several hours, with the first phase being held at 4am on Wednesday at Handampia Village.  The Pokomo Council of Elders presided over the elaborate ceremony, which was strictly anchored on culture and tradition.  Later mid-morning, Raila Odinga, who is the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential candidate and ODM leader, paid the governor a courtesy call. The two later embarked on political rallies at Garsen and Magarini areas.  The Pokomo elders said they bestowed the kingpin honour on Ghodhana because “he has been committed to restoring peace and stability in the county”.  In his re-election campaign, Ghodhana said he is seeking to resettle at least 60,000 constituents who have been affected by perennial floods.  He is also seeking to continue encouraging peaceful solutions to land conflicts in the county.
