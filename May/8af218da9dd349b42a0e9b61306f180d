One person has died and scores of others were seriously injured after a lorry rammed into seven vehicles along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.  The accident occurred near Kinungi, 15kms from Naivasha town, after the driver of the Naivasha-bound lorry reportedly lost control and rammed into the vehicles that included a matatu, causing a massive traffic snarl-up.  Confirming the incident, Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the injured were rushed to Naivasha Sub-County Hospital.  "We had a grisly road accident along the highway where a lorry has hit seven other cars killing one and injuring over ten people," said Waweru.
