Moi Girls High School Eldoret lost property of unknown value after a fire outbreak destroyed the institution’s science laboratory on Thursday night.  The cause of the 11 pm fire incident is yet to be ascertained. The night inferno was contained on time with all students confirmed to be safe.  The school's Board of Management convened a meeting today and assured parents that the girls are safe and normal learning has already resumed.  Speaking after the board meeting, the Principal Secretary (PS) State Department of Broadcast and Telecommunication in the Ministry of ICT Esther Koimett said an assessment was ongoing following the incident.   Koimett, who also chairs the school board, said the Public Works Department is still assessing the premises and will give out a report later in the day. She assured parents that the students are safe and that reconstruction of the laboratory would start after the assessment.  The Executive Secretary Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) in Uasin Gishu, Elijah Maiyo, asked the government to carry out a facelift of the school that is among the academic giants in the country.  The school, through text messages, had earlier in the morning communicated to parents updating them on the incident and also assuring them of their girls' safety.  “Good morning parents. I am sorry to inform you that yesterday at about 11 pm, a fire broke out in our science laboratories and has destroyed property of unknown value. The fire was contained and the girls are safe and calm and we thank God for that. Our normal school programmes shall continue. Blessed day.
