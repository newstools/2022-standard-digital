The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal has stopped ODM from submitting Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi's name to the electoral commission.  This follows an appeal by Dr Nicholas Kut over the party's decision to award the MP the ticket for the August elections.  “The interested party is restrained from accepting, clearing or publishing in Kenya gazette the name of Atandi or any other person as the nominee for Alego Usonga constituency in the 9th August, 2022 election,” says the notice signed by presiding member Willy Mutumbwa.  ODM or any other interested party should respond to the application by today before the hearing on Saturday.  The party’s National Elections Board issued the legislator with a nomination certificate on Monday.   “The Central Committee met on Sunday 8th May 2022, reviewed the cases pursuant to the directions issued by the tribunals and guided by the Rules 8(b) and 23(2) of the Party Primaries and Nomination Rules on the direct nominations, nominated candidates listed in the table,” said the board chair Catherine Mumma.  On May 1, the tribunal nullified the nomination of Mr Atandi and ordered fresh elections on May 4, arguing that the primaries were marred with irregularities.   It also set aside ODM appeals tribunal decision that upheld Mr Atandi’s victory.   By Stephanie Wangari | 32 minutes ago By Patrick Beja | 4 hours ago By Special Correspondent | 5 hours ago By Standard Team | 5 hours ago
