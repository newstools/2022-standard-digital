Woman Rep Gladys Wanga and former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero are blaming each other for violence in which a number of people were injured and 18 motorbikes damaged in Karachuonyo Constituency.  Wanga and Kidero are the only Homa Bay governor aspirants.  It is reported that the violence occurred when their supporters clashed at Wagwe Village on Sunday evening, leaving several people injured and property destroyed.  Rachuonyo North Sub-county Police Commander Lydia Parteiyie confirmed that two people had recorded statements with them.  “People who have recorded statements on injuries. Others had also reported that their motorcycles were destroyed,” Parteiyie said. Wanga and Kidero pointed accusing fingers at each other over the violence, with each claiming that their supporters were attacked in the clashes.  “My supporters were attacked in the violence. One of them is nominated MCA Pamela Odira who was hospitalised after she was hit with a stone on the head,” Wanga said.  Through the chairman of his campaign secretariat Sam Omboya, Kidero accused Wanga of attacking his supporters who were waiting for him so that he could address them during his campaign rallies.  “Our attention has been drawn to senseless attacks on innocent persons by people believed to have been sent by our opponent in the gubernatorial race. We are urging our opponent and Kenyans at large to embrace brotherhood and sisterhood during this electioneering period because there must be a winner and loser,” Omboya wrote in a press release.  Homa Bay County Commissioner Moses Lilan said they are investigating the matter.  “We are following this matter very keenly to ensure those who are culpable are brought to book. We don’t want violence in our county,” Lilan said.  By Harold Odhiambo | 15 hours ago By Lucas Ngasike | 15 hours ago By Jacob Ng’etich | 15 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 15 hours ago
