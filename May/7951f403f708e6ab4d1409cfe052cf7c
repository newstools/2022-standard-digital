Grief engulfed a village in Homa Bay County after a 35-year-old miner was killed in a quarry.  The man identified as Joseph Otieno died on Friday after he was crushed to death while mining in the quarry.  Otieno met his death in Raroki quarry site situated at Siburi village, Kawadhgone Nyongo Location in Rachuonyo North sub-county.  The area Chief Kennedy Sindala said Otieno died on the spot.  “Those who were with him tried to rescue him but they were unable to remove the huge stone because of its weight,” said Sindala. The miners raised alarm to the area residents who also failed to rescue him.  It forced the residents to break the stone into three pieces using a hammer to remove Otieno’s body.  The administrator urged residents to be careful when carving stones.  He said there is a need for the county government to ensure safety measures at the mining sites.  “This site is the main source of livelihood for residents of this village. It is also a source of revenue for the county government. The county should consider how to implement policies that ensure the safety of the miners,” Sindala said.  The body was moved to Kendu Adventist Hospital Mortuary.  By Harold Odhiambo | 7 hours ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By Eric Abuga | 2 days ago
