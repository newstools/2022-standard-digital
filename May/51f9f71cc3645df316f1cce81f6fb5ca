KenGen head office in Nairobi. [Boniface Okendo,Standard]  The use of costly thermal power producers rose 67 per cent last year following poor rains that resulted in reduced electricity generation from hydropower dams even as the country saw an increase in the amount of power produced through wind and solar power.  The thermal plants, which generate electricity by burning heavy fuel oil, increased the amount of power they fed to the national electricity grid to 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh – or simply units of power) in 2021.  This meant that the power producer accounted for 10 per cent of the 12.4 billion units of electricity that Kenyans consumed last year, which had previously dropped to about six per cent.  This was a 67.3 per cent increase compared to 754 million units that they had produced in 2020. Production by thermal power plants has been coming down over years, reducing to 754 million units last year from a high of 2.5 billion in 2018.    “Total electricity generation rose by seven per cent to 12,414 gigawatt hours (12.4 billion kWh) in 2021, partly attributable to the increase in thermal electricity generation which rose by 67.3 per cent,” said the Kenya Economic Survey 2022 published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.  The KNBS report added that “hydroelectricity generation decreased by 13.2 per cent to 3,675 GWh in 2021.”  There was also a reduction in the amount of electricity generated by geothermal power plants which had been attributed to the scheduled maintenance of some of the major plants.  With the increased use of the thermal plants, the amount of fuel they consumed last year nearly doubled to 147,500 tonnes from 75,800 tonnes of fuel they used in 2020.  “Fuel sales to sectors involved in power generation increased by 94.5 per cent to 147,500 tonnes in 2021,” said the Survey.  The thermal power plants have over time been blamed for the high cost of power.  This is largely on account of the pass-through cost, which is referred to as Fuel Cost Charge.
