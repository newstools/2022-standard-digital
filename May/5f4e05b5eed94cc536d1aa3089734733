Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga has promised to appoint a new Cabinet if elected, contrary to claims that she will retain top officials serving in the outgoing administration.​  Ms Wanga is seeking to succeed Governor Cyprian Awiti on ODM ticket.  Political leaders opposed to the Woman Rep's candidature claim that she is likely to incorporate some members of Mr Awiti’s cabinet in her administration.      A section of residents opposed to the governor's leadership have accused him of poor service delivery. “My cabinet will comprise fresh people with fresh ideas which can promote development in our county. We want to make Homa Bay a better county,” Ms Wanga said.  Speaking when she met teachers from Rangwe constituency in a hotel in Kochia ward, the Woman Rep assured residents that her leadership skills and the experience of her running mate Oyugi Magwanga will ensure proper resource management.  “I have experience of 20 years both in the public and private sectors. I have what it takes to manage resources of this county as a governor,” she said.  Ms Wanga promised to transform the health sector where services have currently been paralysed due to workers’ strike.  “Health sector is key in promoting well-being of the people. I will equip our health facilities with drugs and personnel to ensure residents get uninterrupted services,” she said.  She also pledged to improve other sectors such as agriculture, roads, education and water services.  Mr Magwanga urged residents to vote for ODM candidates saying they have good development plans for the county.  “Anger can make someone err and cause irreparable damage. Let us avoid anger and vote Gladys Wanga as the next governor of Homa Bay,” he said.  Wanga got a boost after teachers in Rangwe constituency declared support for her governor bid.
