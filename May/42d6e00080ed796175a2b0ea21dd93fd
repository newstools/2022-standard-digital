The panel selecting Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential hopeful Mr Raila Odinga’s running mate will present names of three shortlisted nominees today.  The advisory panel chaired by Dr Noah Wekesa was to submit the names yesterday, but postponed following Mr Odinga’s absence, as he campaigned at the Coast.  Yesterday Dr Wekesa said the report was ready. “We did not know that our party leader would be out of town. I only received this information this morning,” he said at Serena Hotel in Nairobi. “Our press statement was prepared in view of fact that we were at the same time to report to our party leader. He has assured he will be here tomorrow.”  The advisory panel interviewed Wiper leader Mr Kalonzo Musyoka, Narc-Kenya’s Ms Martha Karua, Murang’a Woman Rep Ms Sabina Chege, former Gatanga MP Mr Peter Kenneth, Ms Stephen Tarus, Agriculture CS Mr Peter Munya and governors Ms Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Mr Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Mr Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mr Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru).  Mr Odinga has until May 16 to submit the running mate name to Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Mr Musyoka was a surprise appearance, having previously said he would not face the panel. Mr Odinga has various options; he can go with the familiarity of a joint ticket with Mr Musyoka, with whom he has twice run for the presidency. But his intention to reap from Central region could also see him pick a running mate from the region.
