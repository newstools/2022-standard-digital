A second autopsy requested by the police on the body of Memusi Sankok, the son of nominated MP David Sankok, will be conducted today.  Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Nairobi have taken up the investigations and launched a fresh probe into the case, alleged to be suicide.  Narok County Criminal Investigations Officer Mwenda Ethaiba said that there was need for the second autopsy for thorough forensic analysis as the first postmortem was inconclusive.  "We need the second autopsy that will take place tomorrow (Friday) because we are doing some forensic analysis on the body, and that can only be done by a certified government pathologist with a background in forensic analysis," said Mwenda   He added that the procedure will be carried out by Johansen Oduor, the Chief Government pathologist.  The initial postmortem was conducted at Longisa Hospital in Bomet County last week but the police have requested a second opinion to determine the circumstances under which the 15-year-old Form Two student at Kericho High School reportedly shot himself.  According to Mwenda the second autopsy and further analysis will be done in Nakuru.  Julius Kuiyoni, a member of the funeral organising committee, said they were yet to set a new burial date. The burial was initially set for Tuesday.  By George Maringa | 2 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 2 hours ago By George Maringa | 4 hours ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 4 hours ago
