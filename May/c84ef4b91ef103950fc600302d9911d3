The Ministry of Interior and Coordination Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho (pictured) has given Kirinyaga County Commissioner Moses Ivuto one month to crack down on hooligans who disrupt political meetings in the county.  Speaking in Kabare in Gichugu Constituency while on a development tour, Kibicho accused politicians of perpetrating acts of hooliganism in the county.  “There are people who will move out of this county whenever we have visitors. A few people look for hooligans and goons to cause havoc,” he said.  Kibicho said as the Interior PS, he will not allow Kirinyaga to be used as a bad example where leaders with divergent opinions are not allowed to speak. “Plan your meeting and invite people to sell your agenda, if they like your agenda, they elect you, if they don’t they will leave you,” he said.
