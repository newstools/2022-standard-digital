Detectives in Londiani are holding a police officer suspected of shooting and injuring a 19-year-old passenger in a case of road rage.  Raymond Bore, who sustained a gunshot wound on the left side of the neck is fighting for his life at Kericho County Hospital.  He was rushed to Londiani sub-county hospital where he was given first aid and referred to Kericho hospital.  Londiani OCPD Joseph Mutungi said an altercation between two motorists saw one of them remove and discharge his pistol at Londiani road junction.  He said the commotion ensued after a driver of a Toyota Probox the suspect had hit came out to question him over the incident. "The officer began to abuse the man before removing his pistol," said Mutungi.  The OCPD added said the suspect aimed at the driver of the Probox, but missed the target and hit Bore on the left side of the neck.  Mutungi said the officer then boarded his vehicle and sped off towards Muhoroni. He was arrested at Kapcheplanga along the Londiani-Muhuroni junction.
