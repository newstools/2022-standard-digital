Devolution Empowerment Party (DEP) which has its roots in Mount Kenya East has issued nomination certificates.  Aspirants for various seats from Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Isiolo and Laikipia counties received their nomination documents from DEP national elections board member Kinoti Imanyara.  A total of 83 candidates gunning for various seats received the documents, and Imanyara said they settled on a “scientific process” in picking their flag bearers.  “We used scientific ways of coming up with the members to determine how suitable one was and how popular they were. We also used consultations and consensus,” said Imanyara.  Kiraitu, while urging aspirants to campaign vigorously for the seats said the “Bus party” had organised training sessions to arm them with vote hunting strategies. Governor Kiraitu Murungi dismissed those who had been opposed the formation of a party in Mount Kenya East, pointing to the candidates it had in various counties.     “The Bus is in Laikipia, Wajir, Busia, Mombasa. It is everywhere, Tharaka Nithi, Embu, Nairobi. Who said the bus had no fuel. Could it have reached there without fuel? We are going to be winners,” Kiraitu said.  He told the aspirants not fear the “big” parties, and urged them to campaign vigorously.  “Since the Bus party is not your common party, experts will train our candidates on campaign strategies,” he said.  Kiraitu said that the party is in the Raila Odinga’s Azimio coalition and added that he is sure he will be re-elected.
