[Denish Ochieng, Standard]  Members allied to Deputy President William Ruto have raised concern over the intensified engagement of Cabinet Secretaries in politics.  They said Cabinet Secretaries are openly campaigning for Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga. The United Democratic Alliance listed Cabinet Secretaries Fred Matiang’i (Internal Security), Eugene Wamalwa (Defence) and Joe Mucheru (Information and Communication), Peter Munya (Agriculture) and Mutahi Kagwe (Health).  They said the CSs must decide whether they will be neutral in working with Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) or resign and become official ODM agents. Addressing the Media at Hustler Centre in Nairobi, UDA campaign team led by Josphat Nanok, Director General of the Presidential campaign challenged the Cabinet secretaries to desist from involving themselves in politics. "We have noted a tendency by senior government officials to purport to assume roles and positions intended to influence the conduct and the outcome of the August 2022 election, in particular ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru for continuously breaching Section 15 of the Election Offences Act 2016 and for involving themselves publicly in campaigning for Azimio La Umoja Presidential candidate Raila.   We call out the same Cabinet Secretary and his colleagues for their open, flagrant and shameless association and promotion of one political coalition and its presidential candidate," said Nanok.
