Speaking at the function, Bidco’s Group Director Chris Diaz said the concept of “immune-boosting” food and beverages is still on high demand, hence the firm’s move to introduce joOz Boost+ (plus). “The contemporary consumer is health-conscious, we are also aware that our active population remains keen on products that help boost their immune systems as well as cultivate their inner strength; therefore, our responsibility is to meet the growing consumer demand with quality and affordable products,” said Diaz.
