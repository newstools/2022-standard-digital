Nyamira Senatorial candidate Adams Mochenwa morning pulled a rare stunt in Nyamira Town after he rode on a donkey to the electoral body's offices to seek clearance to run for the seat.  There was heavy traffic on the main Town street as a crowd of motorcyclists and supporters walking on foot barricaded the main road.  Mochenwa, 28, rode on the male donkey from Borabu County Inn to Nyamira County headquarters offices yesterday where the electoral body is housed, about one and a half kilometres apart.  Police officers in the town however did not have any difficulties controlling the crowd that was pressing to continue accompanying Mochenwa to the IEBC offices from accessing the county's main gate.  Only the candidate and the co-rider managed to go past the police toward the IEBC offices. Speaking after being handed his nomination certificate by County Returning Officer Antony Njoroge, Mochenwa said he chose to ride on a donkey to communicate to the residents of the county what kind of leadership he will offer them once elected.  "This is akin to what Jesus did in Jerusalem as we read from the Bible. Riding on the donkey was a sign of humility, service and dedication to doing for the people of Nyamira what they have lacked for many years," Mochenwa said.  The youthful candidate was among four candidates who were lined up for clearance by the Commission on Monday.  On Sunday, the incumbent, Senator Okong'o Mogeni was the first person to be cleared by County IEBC Returning Officer Antony Njoroge.
