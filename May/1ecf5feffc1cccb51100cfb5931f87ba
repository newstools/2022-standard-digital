A 22-year-old man is in police custody after confessing to killing his six-month-old baby in Nandi County.  The suspect from Kamonjil village in Chesumei Sub-county is alleged to have killed the infant and dumped her body in a pit latrine after differing with her mother over upkeep.  Initial police investigations indicated the baby's mother was angry with the man and decided to take the baby to him because he had failed to provide.  Relatives reported the baby as missing to police on Thursday after the suspect left and returned without the baby, leading to his arrest.   Upon interrogation, the suspect is said to have led the security team to the Chepterit Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) compound and showed them the toilet where he had dumped the body. Police under the command of Chesumei OCPD John Nzioka retrieved the body.  “The suspect is claimed to be the biological father of the deceased, but we are yet to establish the reason he killed his daughter. From observation, the baby must have been killed before being dumped into the pit latrine. The body had started decomposing,” he said.   Mr Nzioka said the suspect will remain in police custody awaiting arraignment in court next week. Meanwhile, the body of the infant was taken to Kapsabet County Hospital mortuary pending postmortem examination.
