A Kiambu MCA is among the four people detained for ten days  over the murder of a man in Juja.  On Thursday, the representative of Githobokoni Ward in Gatundu North, Samuel Njenga, was arraigned before a Thika court alongside his partner Julia Wambui and friends Stephen Macharia, Alex Njihia and Elizabeth Nyambura over the death of Gerald Gachugu.   The police said preliminary investigations have pointed to a love triangle with reports that Njenga and Gachugu had been fighting over a woman.  Through a miscellaneous application, the investigating officer Evans Kipter told Thika senior resident magistrate Margaret Kurumbu that they needed more time to conclude investigations. This was after it emerged that Gachugu died at the MCA's home in Juja sub-County.  Gachugu succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday after a confrontation at the MCA's residence at West View Estate.  Court papers indicated that this happened after Gachugu found the MCA escaping with his girlfriend.  “There was an altercation that ended in a fight during which Gachugu was hit on the forehead,” the investigating officer told the court.  The prosecution opposed a bail application fearing they would interfere with witnesses.  Kipter told the court that they want to establish who responded to the fight and transferred Gachugu to a hospital.  Wambui and Nyambura, in their mitigation, requested the court to release them on bond as their children were alone.  However, the court ruled that a Children's Officer will be assigned to ensure the minors are safe and comfortable.  The magistrate ruled that the suspects will be granted legal representation.
