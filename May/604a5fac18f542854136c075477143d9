Form One learners receive back-to-school goodies  MCA Patrick Muthuri when he distributed shoes to learners joining Form One. [Phares Mutembei, Standard]  A local foundation is buying shoes for learners who sat KCPE as they join Form One.  Started by Abothoguchi West MCA Patrick Muthuri, the foundation also runs a programme “Girls Always in School” which provides learners with sanitary towels.   Muthuri said he decided to buy shoes to boost the students' morale as they joined various high schools. “My friends and I decided to buy shoes for all of them, irrespective of the marks they got or the schools they had been admitted. It was a way of reducing the burden held by parents,” said Muthuri.   By Phares Mutembei | 3 hours ago By Ndung’u Gachane | 12 hours ago By Boniface Gikandi | 1 day ago By George Njunge | 3 days ago
