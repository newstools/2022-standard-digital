Kenya Prisons Service Commissioner-General Brigadier (Rtd) John Kibaso Warioba. [Kenya Service Service]  Kenya Prisons Service Commissioner-General Brigadier (Rtd) John Warioba has defended the recent recruitment of graduate constables, saying the exercise was transparent.  The Prisons boss was reacting to claims by some warders that serving warders with degrees were overlooked in preference to civilian cadets.  The warders claimed junior officers who are degree holders had been left out of the exercise, yet some of them have been in the service and deserve to be promoted.  “The officers are mixing issues, the recruitment that we did was purely for civilians then there were internal promotions that we did for our officers,” said Mr Warioba. He explained that the internal promotions mainly targeted graduate constables, but the available slots could not accommodate them all.  “Those considered for cadets were graduates and for the nurses; clinicians were diploma holders in the recruitment that was purely for civilians,” added Mr Warioba.  Some warders who spoke to The Saturday Standard had claimed that out of over 250 serving officers who applied for the promotions, less than 50 were considered.   By Mactilda Mbenywe | 6 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 6 hours ago By Kamore Maina and Daniel Wesangula | 6 hours ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 10 hours ago
