Some professionals and clerics from Ukambani have urged Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to reconsider his decision to run for president and instead re-open talks with the Azimio-One Kenya coalition.  In a statement read on their behalf by Ben Mwongela, the professionals said Mr Musyoka’s best chances are in Azimio. Going it alone will not be good for the Kamba community, the statement said.  The professionals said the coalition stands a better chance of forming the next government and Mr Musyoka should fight for his space.  “Since our leader, Mr Musyoka agreed to work with ODM leader Raila Odinga for the third time, we urge him to reconsider his decision and work with Azimio as well as marshal his supporters.”   They said they are optimistic the Wiper leader will return to Azimio.   The professionals told Mr Musyoka that being part of Azimio is necessary for Ukambani’s unity, stability and economic progress.  The clerics drawn from the lower Eastern region led by Apostle Peter Kathalu said the position Mr Musyoka is being offered in Azimio needs to be clearly spelled out.    “Any office offered to him that is not constitutional will not be accepted by the Kamba community. We need assurance because Mr Musyoka has sacrificed a lot for the nation.”  Mr Kathalu added that the community cannot afford another stint outside government, having been in the Opposition in the last decade. Mr Musyoka, who is outside the country, is expected back mid this week when he is expected to announce his final position.  A team is said to be negotiating a power-sharing formula between Mr Odinga and Mr Musyoka should the Wiper leader decide to go back to the Azimio fold.
