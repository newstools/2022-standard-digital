Education CS George Magoha [Mose Sammy, Standard]  Education CS George Magoha has directed contractors to complete construction of classrooms and laboratories before the August elections. Adequate infrastructure remains one of the biggest challenges to the full implementation of the Competency-Based Curriculum.  The 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school envisioned by the government and the expected double intake of Form One in January 2023 is a warning that schools must build extra classrooms and dormitories to accommodate the learners.  According to Prof Magoha, Sh8 billion has already been allocated for schools infrastructural development.  However, Magoha has expressed fear that cartels target to steal at least Sh2 billion through shady deals. Measures should therefore be put in place to ensure unscrupulous head teachers do not collude with cartels to steal the money and inconvenience learners.
