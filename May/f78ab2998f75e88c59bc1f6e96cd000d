[Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  Safina presidential candidate Jimi Wanjigi has picked Lawyer Willis Otieno as his running mate in the August 9 General Election.  Wanjigi, in his speech on Tuesday, termed Otieno as a patriot who has had his back over the years.  “He is my dear friend who has had my back several times. He pushes me…I know you will protect and hold him, as you will I,” the Safina party leader said.  Otieno, 39, in his acceptance speech, said it was time for the unheard voices of young people to be heard. “I fearlessly and courageously accept the nomination to be Wanjigi’s running mate. I see this as an opportunity for every young person in this country. The time has come when we must stand up and say that our voices must be heard,” he said.  Wanjigi and Otieno are long-time buddies. The lawyer represented the businessman during a raid at his Kwacha offices in Westlands, Nairobi.  Otieno is also the former head of the Raila Odinga presidential campaign.  Elsewhere, independent presidential aspirant Reuben Kigame also named Irene Ngendo Kamau as his running mate.  The celebrated gospel singer launched his presidential bid and laid out his agenda in January this year.  The deadline for naming presidential running mates according to Electoral laws was May 16.
