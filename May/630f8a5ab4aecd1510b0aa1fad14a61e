[Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Kenya’s transportation and storage sector posted a 7.2 per cent growth in 2021 rebounding from a 7.8 per cent decline in 2020. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Economic Survey 2021 attributed the growth to the easing of movement restrictions that had been imposed to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus.  “These (easing of restrictions) included resumption of both domestic and international flights and lifting of curfew that enabled night travel. Consequently, there was a marked improvement in passenger transportation by air, road and railway,” said the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.

Value of output from air transport grew 21 per cent as passenger traffic from all airports grew by 46.7 per cent to 6.6 million in 2021 from 4.5 million in 2020.   The number of domestic air passengers handled rose by 65.5 per cent to 3.8 million passengers in 2021. International passengers increased by 28.9 per cent to 2.7 million in 2021.  On water transport, cargo throughput expanded 1.2 per cent from 34.1 million tonnes in 2020 to 35.4 tonnes in 2021.
