ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula have defended their agreement with Deputy President William Ruto.  Mr Mudavadi noted that in the spirit of transparency and accountability, Kenya Kwanza Alliance made public the agreement.  He said the interests of the Luhya community and Western at large, are guaranteed under the deal. He claimed the Luhya are not represented on the negotiation table of Azimio la Umoja One Kenya and asked the locals to demand to know what’s in store for them.  “People are saying the Luhya cannot deliver even 70 per cent of the votes to Kenya Kwanza, but I want to tell them that in 2007 and 2017 we delivered over 90 per cent to Raila. We will deliver over 90 per cent of the Mulembe vote to Kenya Kwanza,” Mr Mudavadi said.  Speaking during the second day of a series of rallies in Western, the ANC leader said Kenya Kwanza is committed to ensure Dr Ruto wins in round one to save the country the burden of run-off polls. Mr Wetang’ula assured locals that Western will have more Cabinet slots in Ruto’s government.  “Musalia and I mean well for the community. Let no one cheat you that he has the interest of the community at heart more than the two of us have. I am satisfied with my Senate role, and in Kenya Kwanza, we are after the interests of the region,” said Wetang’ula.  The ANC and Ford Kenya leaders were accompanied by Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali, Barasa and a host of aspirants.  They addressed rallies in Tongaren, Sirisia and Mechimeru in Bungoma County, Malava in Kakamega County, Matayos in Busia and Kidundu in Vihiga County.      By Robert Amalemba | 15 minutes ago By Hellen Miseda | 9 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 12 hours ago By Robert Amalemba and Jackline Inyanji | 4 days ago
