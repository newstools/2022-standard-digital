Police in Migori County are searching for a county employee who has been missing since Sunday.  The family of Patrick Lumumba, a water technician, said he told them he was taking a county government motorcycle to the garage but never returned home.  A source said Lumumba was last seen around Soko Mjinga market in Migori town on Sunday evening and was later “abducted” by four people thought to be police officers.  The source said a Toyota Probox stopped where Lumumba was and some of its occupants came out and handcuffed him. “They accused him of misusing a government motorcycle,” said the source who did not wish to be named. Suna East Sub-county police commander Esau Ochorokodi said the matter was reported by Lumumba’s daughter Cynthia Ngango on Sunday around 8pm.
