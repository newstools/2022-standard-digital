ODM leader Raila Odinga with Kisii Governor James Ongwae at the 2022 Africities Conference in Mamboleo Kisumu County on May 17, 2022 [Collins Oduor, Standard]  The ninth edition of the Africities Summit got underway in Kisumu yesterday. Africities brings together several African countries to address issues pertinent to the realisation of Africa’s Vision 2063 (making Africa a global power house) and the United Nation’s Agenda 2030.  Major cities, including intermediary ones like Kisumu, whose populations range between 50,000 and one million people, are experiencing numerous challenges from a bulge in rural/urban migration. These challenges demand immediate solutions.  Delegates should therefore go beyond articulating concerns to addressing hurdles that stand in the way of actualisation of Vision 2063. As President Uhuru Kenyatta rightly observed while opening the conference, governments should prioritise provision of clean drinking water, quality education, poverty reduction and infrastructural development as a prelude to the realisation of their grand plan for Africa.
