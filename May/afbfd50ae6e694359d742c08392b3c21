A former city tout has accused the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal of double standards after it nullified his nomination for the Member of County Assembly (MCA) position.  On May 14, the tribunal nullified Shadrack Machanje's nomination by the ODM party on allegations that it was not procedural.  However, Machanje on Thursday faulted the tribunal for nullifying his nomination before making an about-turn three days later in a different case filed by businessman Kevin Kwere.  In the latter ruling, the tribunal ruled that it had no jurisdiction to hear the complaint.  According to the tribunal, Kwere should have referred the dispute to the party's Internal Dispute Resolution Mechanism. "There was an admission that there was a second nomination. This tribunal found that it did not have jurisdiction and rightly so, any complaint should have been subjected to the party's internal dispute resolution mechanis," Okatch submitted.
