A room setting. [File, Standard]  Residents of Pipeline area in Eastlands woke up to a bizarre incident when two bodies were recovered from a lodging today.  It all started on Monday night at Chairman Lounge, located within Pipeline in Nairobi.  According to a police report by the Criminal Division at Stapol Kware, Embakasi, the incident was reported at 6:15pm.  In the report, a man identified as Anthony Mathenge, the proprietor of the lounge reported that the two - a middle aged man and a woman booked a room in the lodging within the same building that houses the said lodge on the night of Monday, May 9 at 12:35am. At around 2pm that same day, the room attendant became suspicious when the duo failed to checkout.  Police further state that she went to check on them but upon knocking the door, there was no response. This prompted her to report the matter to her boss and subsequently to the police.  “The scene was visited by Kware commanding duty officer and CSIO Embakasi whereby the door to the room was found locked from inside.”  “Entry to the room was gained through breaking of door panes and lifeless bodies of two people, male and female were found lying on the bed holding each other from the shoulders and their lips held firmly to each other,” police said.  Authorities say there was no visible injuries or signs of struggle. “However, the male who had booked the room had bled from the mouth and nose.”  According to police, two identity cards bearing the names were also found at the scene.  No other documents were recovered at the scene. Their bodies were moved to city mortuary awaiting postmortem.
