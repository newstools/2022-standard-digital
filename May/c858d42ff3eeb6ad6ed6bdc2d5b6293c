Two weeks after ODM was ordered to hold fresh nominations in Bondo, it is yet to do so.  On Saturday, supporters of Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda called for a repeat of the primaries as directed by the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT).  Mr Ochanda’s nomination was nullified after his main challenger John Andiwo challenged his victory in the primaries held on April 13.  PPDT gave the party’s National Elections Board (NEB) 72 hours to repeat the elections, which elapsed on May 8.  “NEB and ODM party shall conduct a fresh nomination of Member of Parliament for Bondo constituency through universal suffrage of its members, within 72 hours of this order; that is to say on or before May 8,” read the PPDT decree. Last week, East African Legislative Assembly MP Oburu Oginga waded into the nomination impasse, saying it was unhealthy for the party and Azimio presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga.  Oburu, who was handed a direct ticket for the Siaya County senator seat, said it has been difficult campaigning in the county with the ongoing nomination petitions.  “The party must now move fast and resolve the issues because we want to put such disputes behind us and move on with the campaigns for our presidential candidate,” said Oburu.  Oburu further told The Standard that the Orange party had moved to the High Court to appeal the PPDT ruling, claiming the party has no resources to conduct fresh nominations.  On Friday, the High Court dismissed the appeal seeking to overturn the orders of the tribunal, with the matter being returned to PPDT on Monday (yesterday) for delivery of a ruling on the application for a permanent injunction restraining ODM from forwarding Mr Ochanda’s name to IEBC.
