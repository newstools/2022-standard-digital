The three richest men on earth are collectively worth Sh63.5 trillion, latest Forbes data shows.  They are Tesla boss Elon Musk $219 billion (Sh25.4 trillion), Jeff Bezos of Amazon $171 billion (Sh19.8 trillion) and French fashion mogul Bernard Arnault $158 billion (Sh18.3 trillion).  Until the latest ranking, Bezos occupied the Number One spot for four consecutive years.  The 2022/2023 Kenya’s budget stands at around Sh3.3 trillion. That means the three richest men on earth can collectively finance Kenya’s annual budget for slightly more than 19 years, without the country being taxed or borrowing loans to fund the budget.  In 2021, Elon Musk was Sh7.8 trillion ($68 billion) lower in net value than he is today (May 2022).  Jeff Bezos’s stint as world’s richest man was short-lived compared to his predecessor Bill Gates, who occupied the top spot for 17 years between 1995 and 2017. It’s only in five occasions, within the same period, that he was toppled, though briefly.  That was in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  Between 2010 and 2013, Mexican telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim Helu ranked as the world’s richest man, pushing Gates to second position.
