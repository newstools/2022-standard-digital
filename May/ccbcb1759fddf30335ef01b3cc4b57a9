United Democratic Alliance (UDA) chairman Johnstone Muthama has denied he was about to dump Deputy President William Ruto’s political formation.  A day after another UDA vice-chairman, Kipruto Kirwa, ditched the wheelbarrow party, rumours swelled that Muthama would follow suit on account of alleged dissatisfaction.  “I am in UDA to stay, to form the next government. I cannot be that shortsighted to lose track of where we are headed while we are so close to the destination. That is not the Muthama Kenyans know,” he told The Standard today.  He said he was happy to chair UDA at a time campaigns have become issue-based. "As a party, we have led the way. We have beaten the other side to this, and their attempts to take our approach are showing. Kenyans can clearly tell the difference. How could I then leave my party when we are setting the standards?" Muthama posed.   He said for him to join Azimio la Umoja One Kenya alliance, he would have to join through another political party, yet he has zero working relations with any of them, including the Wiper Democratic Movement. He quit the Wiper party in 2017 after a major fallout with its leadership on the choice of candidates to contest in the General Election of that year.   Muthama who is gunning for Machakos Governor seat on UDA ticket said while his ultimatum to Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua to the people of Machakos for his unmet promises during his tenure, he’s not about to leave UDA.
