A petitioner who had applied to have former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko blocked from Mombasa governorship race wants the case to proceed.  Mr George Odhiambo told High Court the reasons cited by his fellow petitioner, Mr Ndoro Kaguya, as grounds for withdrawing the entire petition, were baseless and abuse of the court process.  Kaguya made the application seeking to withdraw the petition on April 22, when he told Justice John Mativo he realised Sonko’s impeachment in December 2020 was politically motivated and illegal.
