Nine counties are set to benefit from a Sh500 million showroom in Kisumu being established by the motor vehicle distributor CFAO Motors Kenya, formerly Toyota Kenya.  The facility will also serve Busia, Siaya, Vihiga, Kakamega, Kisii, Nyamira, Homa Bay and Migori.  Construction work will take a year, CFAO Managing Director Arvinder Reel said yesterday during the groundbreaking ceremony.   Mr Reel said the new branch is a show of commitment to the lake region economic hub by the vehicle distributor. He said with two authorised service centres in the western block, the Kisumu facility will enhance CFAO Motors Kenya‘s business. “Lake region customers will access the sale of vehicles, spare parts and services under one roof,” MD Reel said.
