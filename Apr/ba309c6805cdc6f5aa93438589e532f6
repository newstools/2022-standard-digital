[Boniface Okendo, Standard]  A team tasked with spearheading consensus among Jubilee Party aspirants has expressed dismay after its proposals were rejected.  The Standard has established that the team met aspirants for the parliamentary seats at a Nakuru hotel on Sunday but did not make headway.  The failure by aspirants to agree on going the consensus way has sent the party back to the drawing board, leaving it with options like issuing direct tickets.  “The party called us except those in the gubernatorial race to a meeting. Nobody was willing to step down for the other in the positions MPs, woman representative and senate,” said an aspirant.   Another aspirant explained that the party was strongly for consensus among aspirants but each believed that they should be given an equal chance to seek leadership mandate from the electorates.  “Every aspirant has a following which they believe is enough to help them clinch the seat. It was difficult to convince a person they are not the right candidate,” she said.  In an earlier interview, the party’s Director of Elections and Kieni MP Kanini Kega had told journalists that the party will field candidates in all positions in the county in the polls.  In 2017, the Jubilee Party clinched 10 out of 11 MP seats, the governor, the Senate, and Woman MP post and commands the majority in the county assembly.      By Judah Ben-Hur | 3 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 3 hours ago By Special Correspondent | 3 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 11 hours ago
