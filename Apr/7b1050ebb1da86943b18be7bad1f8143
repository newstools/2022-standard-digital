ODM leader Raila Odinga is expected to fly to the US on Friday, weeks after touring the UK.  Mr Odinga is expected to hold meetings with leaders as well as engage Kenyans in the diaspora.  He is expected to spell out his vision for the country and bilateral relations with the US in the event he becomes president. Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, touted as Mr Odinga’s possible running mate, is expected to join him on the trip.  Deputy President William Ruto also visited the UK and US last month. During the trip, the DP alleged that there were plans to rig the August 9 election.  During his UK trip last month, Mr Odinga dismissed the rigging claims during engagements with various think-tanks, asserting his confidence in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to conduct a free poll. Mr Odinga also defended his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta and criticised Dr Ruto for claiming that the government had been swallowed by the opposition and vice versa.  “There cannot be a government in opposition. He is traveling with government security. I have to pay my airfare to come here, same with all the people who have come with me. None of them has been paid for by the government,” Mr Odinga said in London.
