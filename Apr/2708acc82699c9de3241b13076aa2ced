The fate of Nyandarua County Speaker Ndegwa Wahome's bid to vie for governorship hangs in the balance after Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) revoked his nomination certificate.  CCK leader, Moses Kuria, said the party will not present a candidate for the seat. Instead, it is opting to support UDA nominee Ndirangu Badilisha.  Mr Wahome was awarded a CCK nomination certificate two weeks ago and has vowed to vie for the seat under all circumstances.  "Kindly be notified that I am firmly in the race for governor,  Nyandarua, on a Chama Cha Kazi ticket. I am already duly nominated to fly the CCK flag in Nyandarua and I am holding a nomination certificate to that effect.  "Kenya is governed by the rule of law and I want to assure all our party members and supporters that I will be on the ballot in the August elections on the CCK ticket," he said in a statement. His lawyer Waichungo Martin said that they had moved to court to file a petition.  "We are following the law. That is why we have moved to court," he said.  However, Kuria told The Standard that Wahome was not popular in the county and that was why the party revoked the certificate.
