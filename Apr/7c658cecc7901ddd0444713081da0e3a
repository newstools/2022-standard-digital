The arch archbishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya Jackson ole Sapit has urged Kenyans to reject political aspirants with questionable integrity.  Sapit said there are leaders facing corruption-related cases in court but are seeking elective positions in the August elections.  “We appeal to the electorates to examine all political leaders seeking positions and reject all those who are facing corruption charges and those found guilty of stealing public funds,” said Sapit.  Speaking during the closing ceremony of the week-long conference for Anglican church bishops and senior clergy on Thursday, the archbishop announced that the ACK church will be carrying out civic education in churches to enlighten the electorates to vote for visionary leaders.  “There is an urgent need to curb plunder and misuse of public resources,” said Sapit. His call comes a day after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission’s pronouncement that it cannot bar political aspirants with integrity issues.    By Obare Osinde | 1 hour ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 3 hours ago By Brian Otieno | 4 hours ago By Stephanie Wangari | 4 hours ago
