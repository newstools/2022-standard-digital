Devolution PS Mr Julius Korir was yesterday charged with assaulting his wife Mrs Evelyn Chepkorir Koech.  Mr Kiplangat was presented before Milimani Chief Magistrate Ms Susan Shitubi in the afternoon after he failed to appear in the morning. His lawyer had claimed he had a problem with his spinal cord.   The PS denied the charge of assaulting his wife at Ndalat road in Karen, Nairobi on September 17, 2020.   He was released on a bond of Sh20,000 or alternatively pay a cash bail of Sh20,000 with two sureties.   The case will be mentioned on April 19.  Last month the PS and his wife, through their lawyers, told the court they had agreed to settle the case out of court within 30 days. The PS had at the time failed to appear in court for the fourth time after he allegedly contracted Covid 19 while on official duty in Tanzania.   Prosecutor Ms Alice Mathangani was opposed to the matter taking 30 days to be settled. “Your honour, I request the court to give the parties two weeks,” Ms Mathangani pleaded.  At the time, lawyers for the complainant and accused told the court two weeks was not enough, as the process involved change of ownership of some properties.   The PS was twice asked to appear in court for plea taking for not turning up as directed by court. The prosecution had earlier urged the court to issue last summons to him to attend court, or a warrant of his arrest be issued.  “I warn the accused to take court matters seriously and attend court sessions,” said Ms Shitubi.  The prosecution yesterday morning told the Magistrate the parties had not reached a consensus.
