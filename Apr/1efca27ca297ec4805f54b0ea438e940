Nandi Hills MP hopeful Wesley Kogo, who died in an accident last week, was buried on Saturday. Kogo was travelling to Nairobi for a morning vernacular radio talk show when the accident occurred.   He was eulogised as a leader whose star had started shining at a tender age.  Political leaders at the burial included Kapseret MP Mr Oscar Sudi, Nandi Governor Mr Stephen Sang, Soy MP Mr Caleb Kositany, Kimilili's Mr Didmus Barasa, Nandi Senator Mr Samson Cherargei and several MCA candidates nominated in last Thursday's UDA primaries.   "Kogo was not rich, but was really influential with his political agenda... he had a huge following of young people, who make the majority. He was determined to bring change," said Mr Sang.   The public had raised Sh1.6 million towards Kogo's political campaign kitty last November. Following Kogo's death, UDA parliamentary nominations in Nandi Hills moved to tomorrow. Mr Alfred Keter is the Nandi Hills MP and will be seeking the UDA ticket for a third term.  Mr Keter will now face off with Mr Bernard Kitur, Ms Irine Jemutai, Mr Robert Chepkwony, Ms Irine Lelei and Mr Abraham Limo for the UDA ticket.   Mr Sudi told locals: "Kogo was an aspirant with inspiring manifestos but death robbed us a leader. You should not get into inept leadership again. We need a leader who will join hands with other legislators campaigning for DP William Ruto's presidential aspiration rather than a person causing division and betraying community."  Mr Kositany and Mr Barasa urged the electorate to elect a different MP to get a consolidated leadership that would spearhead Dr Ruto's presidential campaigns.
