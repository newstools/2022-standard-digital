April 18, 2022: Boston, MA, USA:  Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya crosses the finish line [Eric Canha-USA TODAY Sports]  Peres Jepchirchir and Evans Chebet gave us an evening to remember on Monday after they won 126th edition of Boston Marathon – the world’s oldest marathon.  Their wins and the performance of other Kenyan athletes attests that we can send strong marathon teams to World Athletics Championships in Eugene, USA, and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, UK, in August.  It’s no doubt that Kenyans produced the best results since Ibrahim Kipkemboi Hussein became the first man to win Boston Marathon in 1988.  Our athletes deserve a standing ovation given the depth of the field that competed in the American race. Boston win is worth bragging about. We should now take the cue from them and ensure we stop Ethiopian aggression at the World Championships. Let’s hope we will carry the same winning spirit to the global stage.     By Editorial | 1 hour ago By Wilson Chacha | 1 hour ago By Mohamed Guleid | 1 hour ago By Veronica Onjoro | 7 hours ago
