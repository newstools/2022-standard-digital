[Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  The government has commissioned the Sh178 million Nasukuta export abattoir in West Pokot.  The abattoir is expected to improve the income of the residents and boost the county’s economy.  Speaking during the event, Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, who is also the acting Devolution CS, said West Pokot is among 15 counties that benefited from European Union-funded projects.  He said the project is to improve the country’s food security through meat and food processing. He added that other counties have benefited from sweet potato, mango and banana processing factories and commercialisation of fishing. “The facility is expected to minimise the role of middlemen who exploit livestock keepers,” he said.
