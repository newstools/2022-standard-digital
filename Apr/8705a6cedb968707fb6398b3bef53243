Leaders visited the Lee Funeral Home in Nairobi yesterday to view the body of former President Mwai Kibaki.  President Uhuru was the first to arrive at the facility in the afternoon about an hour after announcing the passing on of the third president at State House, Nairobi.    ODM leader Raila Odinga arrived about half-past one and spent about 10 minutes inside. The former Prime Minister had earlier eulogised President Kibaki as a man who served the nation with diligence and honesty.  “He was one of the freedom fighters having served for many years with diligence, fortitude, honesty and transparency,” Raila said. Other leaders were not allowed to check-in save for Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and National Parliament Majority Leader Samuel Phoghisio.  Ngilu described Kibika as a statesman.   “He transformed this country to levels that all Kenyans felt proud of,” Ngilu said.  MP Maina Kamanda, ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna and CAS Beatrice Elachi paid their tributes outside Lee Funeral Home.
