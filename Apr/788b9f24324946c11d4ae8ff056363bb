Kericho Youth Caucus chairman Kiprotich Ngetich addresses members.[Courtesy]  Young people are calling for structured engagement with aspirants for various elective seats in Kericho County to understand their agendas.  Under the umbrella of Kericho Youth Caucus (KYC), the young voters have invited the aspiring governors, senators, Members of Parliament and ward representatives to hear about their plans for them.  KYC chairman Kiprotich Ngetich regretted that those seeking elective positions had hit the campaign trail without concrete programmes for young people.  “While we contend that the battle lines have been drawn in the race to succeed Governor Paul Chepkwony, we are concerned that the leading gubernatorial aspirants have not come out clear on their youth agenda,” said Mr Ngetich. The youth drawn from the 30 wards said they want the governor aspirants to sign a memorandum of understanding committing that they will appoint the youth as county executive committee members and chief officers.  Parliamentary aspirants will be tasked to put on paper how much money from the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) they will channel to youth empowerment programmes.
