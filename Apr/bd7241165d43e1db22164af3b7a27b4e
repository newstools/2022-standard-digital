Kenya Power technicians replace a transformer in Kiwaihiga market, Murang'a. [Boniface Gikandi]  Details of electricians operating in rural areas are being captured by the Kenya Power and security agencies to stop vandalism.  In the past three years, the state corporation has lost equipment worth millions of shillings to vandals looking for copper and transformer oil.  Yesterday, County  Kenya Power Manager Harrison Kamau said the move would weed out crooks who are stealing equipment and doing illegal connections leading to loss of revenue.  “About 50 cases of meter theft are reported monthly. The culprits leave the customers without supply or make illegal connections,” said Kamau on a tour of Kiawaihiga village in Gatanga.   Some residents said they were disconnected when a transformer blew up after being vandalised.  “Church services have been dull due to lack of musical instruments that use electricity," said Michael Njau, a pastor.  A week ago, a suspect survived electrocution in Kirwara after he climbed up an electric pole and slipped on a live line.  Margaret Waruguru urged the company to educate residents about the need to report incidents.
