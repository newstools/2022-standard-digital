Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i. [Edward Kiplimo, Standard]  Perpetrators of political violence will face the full force of the law, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has warned.  The CS, who met with members of the National Assembly Security and Administration of Justice Committee on Tuesday said they will not take lying down any incidents of political violence as the country gears for the August polls.  “There will be no sacred cows in the crackdown on perpetrators of political violence,” Matiang’i stated.  Police officers have also been warned against taking bribes as a means of settling disputes arising from ‘rented political crowds.’ “Bribery of voters and mobilisation of rented crowds are the main security that NPS service is currently facing,” the CS said.  A contingent of security officers has been hired and will be deployed to several parts of the country to maintain peace ahead of party primaries and elections.
