Jubilee Party has unveiled its candidates for the August 9 election, in a list where Kangema MP Muturi Kigano was dropped.  Former Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau got a direct ticket to run as governor, as was radio journalist Everlyn Waithira Muthirania who will fly the party ticket for Woman Rep seat.  Kigano is the only incumbent who suffered a loss as his youthful rival George Kibuku was awarded the ticket at Jubilee Party headquarters by Kieni MP Kanini Kega. Kibuku will now face Peter Kihungi of UDA, Simon Mirema of TSP and Julia Chege of DP.  It was another twist in the political tale of Kigano who first contested his seat in 1974 and was elected in 2017.  Former Senator Kembi Gitura survived the negotiations after he was awarded the certificate which was being eyed by political analyst, Prof Peter Kagwanja. In the negotiation process, Gatanga MP Joseph Ngugi Nduati got a reprieve after he was found the best candidate compared to his rival Anthony Kimani wa Mumbi.    Mathioya MP Peter Kimari was issued with the ticket to defend the seat against his only rival, contractor Johnson Kihato.  Maragua Jubilee nominee is Anthony Chege Wabuku who will fight for the slot with the incumbent Mary Wamaua (UDA) and Lawrence Munga (CCK).  Kigumo MP Wangari Mwangi was issued with a direct ticket to face the UDA's Joseph Munyoro.  In Kandara, the party settled on Peter Kinyanjui Ngugi to face the incumbent Alice Wahome of UDA, while in Kiharu Karanja Mburu Wamatangi will face the incumbent Ndindi Nyoro of UDA.
