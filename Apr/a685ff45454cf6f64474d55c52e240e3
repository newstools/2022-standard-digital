Jimmy Kibaki, the son of former President Mwai Kibaki, on Friday, April 29 said that the late Head of State was fond of Uhuru Kenyatta, and would listen to him (Uhuru) keenly whenever he’d be covered on television.  Jimmy likened the relationship that Kibaki had with Uhuru to that of a father and son.  Jimmy made the remarks at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi during the State Funeral service of Mwai Kibaki, who died aged 90 on April 22.  “Your Excellency [President Uhuru Kenyatta], those of us who understand the dynamics between President Kibaki and you, we know that he was very, very fond of you,” said Jimmy.  “In fact, the relationship he had with you was like that of a father and a son. “There were times I’d watch the evening news on TV with him, at around 7 o’clock, and during the news bulletin, he’d start dozing off, especially when some politicians would speak during coverage.  “And, he’d even turn to me, and tell me: ‘Jimmy, you know this fellow has been speaking for ten minutes, and there’s nothing he has told us’, and he’d go back to dozing.  “But, when you [Uhuru Kenyatta] would come on the screen, he would sit upright and listen very keenly, and after your news item ends, he would turn to me and say ‘[he’s a] good man’, or ‘[he’s a] good fellow’.  “For those of us who knew President Mwai Kibaki well, we knew when he said something like that, it was the ultimate praise. He could not say more than that.”  By Betty Njeru | 1 hour ago By George Maringa | 1 hour ago By George Maringa | 3 hours ago By Stephanie Wangari | 4 hours ago
