The Government has ordered the deportation of Rubis Kenya Chief Executive Officer Jean Bergeron, with the firm under investigation for malpractices that plunged the country into a fuel crisis.  Bergeron is accused of hoarding fuel and exporting the commodity to foreign markets.  Multiple Ministry of Petroleum and Mining sources, including senior Government officials, confirmed to 'The Standard' that the work permit for the French national had been cancelled and that he's been ordered out of the country.  Acting Petroleum and Mining CS Monica Juma is expected to issue a comprehensive statement over the fuel crisis on Thursday, April 14.  It is the second time that the Government is striking within the sector as it tries to restore order in the industry, whose players have, on several occasions, been accused of hoarding fuel. Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) on Tuesday said it would reduce allocation of storage capacity for companies it had identified as having exported fuel to neighbouring countries, even as the domestic market suffered scarcity.
