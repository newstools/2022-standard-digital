A move by ODM to issue direct tickets in Migori County has sparked an outcry from some of the aspirants.  The party had announced that it will only hold nominations for Woman Rep, Suna West Constituency and MCA seats.  But many aspirants and supporters who have been preparing for the primaries ahead of the August 9 ballot are not happy and are saying that is stifling democracy.  The ODM primaries in Migori are slated for today.  On Friday, ODM National Elections Board chair Catherine Mumma outlined the areas where the polls are to be held. ODM chair John Mbadi had on Thursday hinted that aspirants who included Senator Ochilo Ayacko, Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and his Rongo counterpart Paul Abuor will get direct nominations.  For the Uriri Constituency seat, Mark Nyamita has been leading in ODM opinion polls.  In Awendo Constituency, Walter Owino is expected to be given the party ticket.  Aspirants who were unhappy with the ODM move termed it unfortunate.  “When I declared my candidature, voters gave me the mandate to bring change in the constituency. Within a week, I will make my next move known,” businessman Jared Kwaga who is eyeing the Uriri parliamentary seat, said.  Kwaga who said he respects Mbadi and ODM party leader Raila Odinga said the aspirants did not get official communication from the party on direct tickets.  Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo who is vying for governor said she was not informed that her rival Senator Ayacko was to get a direct ticket.  “We were never called and informed of the decision regarding direct tickets. We are ready to vote,” Odhiambo said.  She said the decision by the party was not binding and she was surprised by it.
