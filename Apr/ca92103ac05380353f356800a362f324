Fifteen (15) out of 17 people suspected of stoning Raila Odinga’s helicopter on April 1, 2022 have been freed for lack of evidence.  The Prosecution, however, said it had established evidence against two suspects, Abednego Kiptanui and Kenneth Kipkosgei.  Eldoret Senior Resident Magistrate Emily Kigen on Wednesday, April 13 freed the 15 suspects who couldn’t be implicated because of lack of evidence.  Kiptanui and Kigen are expected to be charged on Wednesday afternoon.  Richard Polo, the Investigating Officer, said the prosecution was given enough evidence to sustain trial against the two. The windshield of Raila Odinga’s chopper was damaged when a crowd attacked him, when he was leaving the homestead of Jackson Kibor at Kabenes in Soy, Uasin Gishu County on April 1.  Kibor was buried that day after succumbing to Covid-19-related complications.     By Macharia Kamau | 1 hour ago By Winfrey Owino | 2 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 3 hours ago By Muriithi Mugo | 6 hours ago
