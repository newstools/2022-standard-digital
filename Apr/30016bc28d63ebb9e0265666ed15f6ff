Azimio la Umoja leader Raila Odinga has appointed former Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju as the Executive Director of the Azimio Secretariat.   Tuju will coordinate all member parties of Azimio la Umoja and will lead the strategic and programs teams that will work to ensure Azimio victory in the August elections.  The announcement was made in a statement to newsrooms by ODM Communications Director Dennis Onyango.  "A communication specialist by training, Hon Tuju has decades of experience in politics and government, having served as Member of Parliament, Cabinet Minister and Jubilee Party Secretary-General.  "The Azimio Coalition party brings together over 20 political parties with diverse regional strengths, opinions and a myriad of leadership that represent the face of Kenya," read the statement.  Tuju's appointment came a month after his resignation as the Jubilee Secretary-General during the party’s National Delegates Convention (NDC) at the KICC.  While making the announcement, Tuju said he was proud of his achievements as secretary-general and thanked President Uhuru for trusting him with the position.  President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was presiding over the convention, expressed gratitude to Tuju for his services and pleaded with Odinga to assist him should he harbour political ambitions.  “Baba, Tuju is our man in Jubilee, if there is a position he is seeking, [even you, ODM] help him out. Help him, let him not be in the cold. You, Joho, I’ve delegated that responsibility to you,” said Uhuru to a nodding Odinga.
