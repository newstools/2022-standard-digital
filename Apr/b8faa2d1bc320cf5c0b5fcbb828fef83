As Kenyans mourn the death of former President Mwai Kibaki, an incident where he was forced to run for his life with one shoe still lingers in the minds of Trans Nzoia residents.  It was on May 23, 1998, at the height of the political agitation to dislodge Kanu from power. Kibaki, the then official leader of the opposition, was to address a major rally.  The meeting had twice been cancelled by police when opposition MPs led by then Kwanza MP George Kapten (deceased), backed by Kanu rebels led by Kipruto Kirwa vowed to hold the rally despite being disallowed by security agencies.     The lawmakers managed to access the venue despite being cordoned off by armed officers. Amid confusion, the officers confronted conveners Kapten and Kirwa, ordering them to call off the event. Former Kitale Mayor Pius Kauka recalls how he also backed the officers to cancel the rally.  Kauka joined the fray as he ordered the opposition lawmakers to leave the venue. "The rally was disrupted and the initially hesitant Kibaki had to take off to save his life," Kauka said.  During the melee, Kibaki like any other attendees, tried to escape but left one of his shoes behind. "I don't know who picked it up for him later."   About 30 raiders took action after officers failed to stop the rally. The crowd killed one of the raiders who tried to hit Kibaki. Opposition leaders later claimed the violence and disruption of the rally was part of a wider plot to assassinate Kibaki. Yesterday, Kauka denied he was the one who picked Kibaki's shoes.  The former Mayor mourned the departed President as a progressive leader, saying he reconciled with him after he took over leadership in 2002.
