The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party has dismissed rigging claims by some political aspirants as the nomination exercise continues across several counties.  UDA National Elections Board (NEB) Chairman Anthony Mwaura Thursday termed the allegations as unfounded rumours.  "Our ballot papers have water marks, serial numbers and nobody can give evidence that the papers have been found anywhere. They cannot even be photocopied," the board chair said.  "We are largely satisfied as a board about this process. So far the turnout has been so good...We are in touch with our returning officers and have been calling them every 30 minutes.”  Several leaders from Bomet County had including Senator Christopher Langat, Woman Rep Joyce Korir, former Mining CS John Mosonik and Nominated MP Wilson Sossion demanded the postponement of primaries over an alleged rigging plot in favour of three aspirants. "The ballot papers and boxes were not secure at all, we were able to access papers that were marked,” Sossion claimed.  Further, the party has summoned aspirants whose supporters destroyed poll materials on Wednesday in Embu County. Officials said the violence was linked to political aspirants in the area.  The aspirants have been summoned to appear before a disciplinary committee on April 16 at the party headquarters.  Kindiki condemned the electoral violence, saying the party abhorred violence, intimidation and obstruction of democracy.  At the same time, the senator warned politicians of interfering with the tallying and announcement of party primaries results.  "Many politicians are unable to deal with the reality of defeat. Our constitution empowers the party to act firmly, strongly and resolutely on violence, intimidation and obstruction of democracy," he said.
