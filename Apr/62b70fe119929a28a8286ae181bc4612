Jubilee Party aspirant for the governor's seat Jamleck Kamau has picked a consultant in entrepreneurship management as his running mate.  Dr Naomi Kagone will partner with Mr Kamau in a bid to trounce Senator Irungu Kang'ata of UDA, former PS Joseph Irungu (DP), Irungu Nyakera of Farmers Party of Kenya and Dr Moses Ndung'u of Safina.  Dr Kagone, who was born in Mathioya and married in Kangema, said their administration would transform the county by empowering women and youth.  She was a director at the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and sits in the Kirinyaga University and JKUAT management councils.   Dr Kagone said she would use her expertise in small enterprises, digital marketing and financial literacy to uplift residents and attract investors. “I believe you cannot separate politics and business. For the trade to thrive there must be a conducive political environment that allows growth and development,” she said.  Mr Kamau said he settled on her after learning of her capacity to inspire growth in the health sector, businesses as well as empowerment of women and youth.  Kamau is the second aspirant after Mr Nyakera to name a running mate. Farmers Party settled on lawyer Catherine Mugo a month ago.  Dr Kagone is the chief executive officer of Poise Business Development Consulting Ltd.
