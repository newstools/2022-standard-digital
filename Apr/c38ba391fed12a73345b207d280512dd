[David Njaaga, Standard]  Kenyans continue to stream in at Parliament building, Nairobi on day two of the public viewing of former President Mwai Kibaki’s body to pay their last respects.  Kibaki’s body will lie in state at Parliament until tomorrow, Wednesday, 5 pm.  Condolence books have been placed at select government offices across the country.  Leaders from across the political divide have mourned Kibaki as a selfless leader, with good intentions for the country during his 10-year tenure. Nairobi Deputy Governor Candidate Prof Philip Kaloki remembered the former president as a stickler for rules.  “Kibaki was a stickler for budgetary allocations. I remember him as a president who was big on infrastructure,” Kaloki told KTN News.    Kitui Central MP Mulu said Kibaki’s presidency will be an unforgettable one, challenging Kenyans to elect sober leaders come the August 9 General Election.  “As Kenyans, this is the time to really look at some good things he did. It is time to put our house in order and elect more sober leaders.”  President Uhuru Kenyatta, accompanied by First Lady Margaret led the country in paying tribute to the former Head of State, on Monday.  His casket, draped in the national flag was escorted in a military gun carriage to Parliament and accorded full military honours.  A national funeral service will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday, April 29.  Several Heads of State and dignitaries are expected to grace the ceremony including Uganda President Yoweri Museveni, Tanzania’s Samia Suluhu, and Rwanda’s Paul Kagame.  Kibaki will then be buried on Saturday, April 30 at his home in Othaya, Nyeri County.
