Teachers are the biggest group of workers who are always at loggerheads with the government. The bone of contention has been their salaries.  For years, they have complained about their pay, and the perennial failure of the authorities to honour its end of the bargain after they have reached an agreement.  Apart from salaries, they have other issues to do with hiring and promotion especially after they have furthered their studies.  Some of these problems did not start with this administration even though some can argue that things have got worse, what with the dilution of the union’s strength to the extent that it is almost dead or nonexistent.  This relationship between the government and teachers makes parents unsure of when schools will close due to teachers strike. As a matter of fact, it plays havoc with their finances too, for, those with children in boarding schools have to prepare for any eventualities since children can be sent home any time. So, even as they send their children to school tomorrow, they are not sure whether there is some unfinished business between teachers and the government that can lead to suspension of learning.  Teachers understand their problems better, and should be listened to when they speak up. It seems the government is finally realising that they are not well rewarded for their duties of shaping young minds and has come up with an award scheme.
