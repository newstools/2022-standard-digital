Green Hass Avocados [Courtesy]  The Kenya Crops and Dairy Market System (KCDMS) has invested over Sh350 million to boost food production in Kisii County, the agency has said.  The funding includes an avocado subsidy programme in partnership with the county.  It involves the distribution of 4,747 seedlings to farmers. KCDMS Director of Agriculture Policy and Institutional Capacity Josephine Songa said the fund has promoted value addition, and expanded market opportunities through likages.  “We aim to contribute towards diverse agricultural production while supporting a shift to higher-value crops and off-farm income-generating activities,” she said during a stakeholder forum in Kisii town yesterday. KCDMS is funded by the United States Agency for International Development. Through collaborations with 22 grant partners and 227 non-grant partners, the agency has facilitated over Sh437 million worth of sales from farmers.  Dr Songa cited Bio farms, Lenack Enterprises and Stawi Foods as some of the small enterprises that have benefited.  The project has also trained 90 support staff, 10 animal health assistants and 11 artificial insemination service providers.
