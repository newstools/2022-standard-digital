Acute water shortage in Marsabit town will be a thing of the past once a Sh2 billion World Bank-funded dam is completed in the next three months.  The dam at Bakuli, on the foothills of Mt Marsabit, has so far reached the fourth phase and will produce 750 cubic litres of water per day.   At the moment, the three other phases produce 250 cubic litres per day for a population of about 100,000.  Locals had been relying on two springs from Bakuli area and due to erratic rainfall, and the destruction of forests that paved way for human settlement, the water source dried up in 2005.  The construction of Sh3 billion dam at Badassa, with the capacity of 1,500 cubic litres of water per day, had stalled, forcing the county administration to seek financial aid from the World Bank and other private players like NGOs. Adan Kanano, CECM for Water and Environment disclosed the development at a meeting convened by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, Swiss Development Aid and NGOs Millennium Water.    The stakeholders launched Northern Counties Water Action plan for Marsabit and Garissa.  The five-year programme is aimed at addressing water woes in the arid and semi-arid region and will also be rolled over to Isiolo, Samburu, Turkana and Mandera.  KNCHR deputy director Cyrus Waweru said access to clean water is a basic human right that should be enjoyed by the citizens and one can sue the government if such is not supplied.  Kanano said the World Bank project would also improve sanitation in the town, adding that work at Bakuli Four was at 75 per cent complete.  ‘‘Construction work is at 75 per cent and the project would be completed by July this year,’’ Kanano said.
