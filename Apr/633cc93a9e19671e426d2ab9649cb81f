EPRA Director-General Daniel Kiptoo said higher landed cost of petroleum products has resulted in the price hike.

In February 2022, the per cubic metre of landed Petrol cost $676.40 (Sh78,140). In March, that rose to $814.85 (Sh94,137).

The landed cost of a cubic metre of Kerosene rose from $619.57 (Sh71,577) in February 2022 to $692.95 (Sh80,054) in March.  “The Government will utilise the petroleum levy to cushion customers from the unusually otherwise high prices,” said Kiptoo.  EPRA announced that ten oil marketing companies have been issued with show cause letters for abetting the nationwide fuel crisis.  Kiptoo says they are under investigation for economic sabotage.
