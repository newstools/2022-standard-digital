Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole Lenku campaign at Kurket in Matapato South Ward, Kajiado Central on  April 16, 2022 [Peterson Githaiga, Standard]  Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has asked members of the Maasai community to vote for Raila Odinga as president.  Mr Musyoka said he had worked together with the ODM leader in the last two elections and their bid to State House now had a boost after getting the support of President Uhuru Kenyatta.  He said they now have their best opportunity to lead the country.  "Our victories in 2013 and 2017 were stolen. We are now more vigilant and with the support of President Kenyatta, we shall win resoundingly," said Mr Musyoka. Speaking in Ng'atataek during the unveiling of Moses Birisha as the Wiper candidate for the Kajiado Central parliamentary seat, Mr Musyoka told the Maa community that their interests will be well catered for in the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya government.    "We want to have a government of people who will not steal land from the Maasai community. We know there are people who will marginalise the community and steal their resources because they are greedy. We shall protect your interests," he said.  The former vice president endorsed Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku for a second term and rallied the Kamba community living in the county to vote for him.  He said Lenku had strongly defended the rights of the Maasai community and he deserved to continue serving the people of Kajiado.  Lenku said Wiper will get the support it needs to clinch the Kajiado Central seat alongside 10 MCAs slots.
