Four children died in a fire incident at Matwiku Bosnia village in Rurii ward Nyandarua County.  The four, aged between three and seven, were sleeping when their wooden house caught fire and was razed on Tuesday night.  Passenga location Chief Daniel Muniu said the minors’ parents were away when the incident happened.  He said neighbours heard screams from the children and rushed to the scene, but by then the whole house was engulfed in flames.  "It was around midnight when the fire started, according to the neighbours. They tried to save the children but unfortunately the fire was so firce,” he said. "The children had locked themselves inside, making it hard to access the house. There were also strong winds that made it impossible for residents to put out the fire,” said Muniu.  He noted that the cause of the fire had not been established, but suspected that some fresh charcoal that had been brought to the house caused it.  He said the entire house was razed during the incident. The children's remains were moved to JM Kariuki Hospital mortuary.  Politicians from the area led by Governor Francis Kimemia condoled with the family, promising to assist them.  "It is sad that we have lost these innocent souls. My government has promised to stand with them during this difficult time,” he said in a statement.  "All the support they need from my government will be dealt with accordingly through the disaster management team. I have already dispatched the team to assist the family,” noted Kimemia.
