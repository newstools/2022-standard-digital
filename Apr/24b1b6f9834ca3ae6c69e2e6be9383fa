The Education ministry said 1,209,697 pupils were placed to secondary schools. In the 2021 KCPE exam, 1,214,031 sat the exam. This means that 4,334 wrote the exam, but were not placed to secondary schools despite Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha saying that 100 per cent primary-to-secondary transition was met.  The Standard, however, understands that there’s a category of candidates who can’t be selected to join secondary schools due to certain reasons including confinement in correctional facilities.
