The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) says it will conduct nominations in 12 counties for the positions of governor, and 19 for the position of Senator.  The party will hold its primaries countrywide on Thursday, April 14.  The nominations will also see 128 MP hopefuls battle it out for the party’s ticket.  Eight hundred and ninety-two (892) people have expressed interest in clinching the party’s ticket for MCA elections.  “The National Elections Board (NEB) has contracted reputable election managers who are currently undergoing treatment, and also recruitment of polling clerks has commenced,” said the party’s National Elections Board chairperson Anthony Mwaura. “The nominations will be held in all electoral areas where there is more than one paid up candidate, and other forms of nominations like consensus have not been applied.”  Mwaura said the Education ministry has approved their request to use schools as nomination centres.  “Kindly note that in some areas there are candidates who were not opposed, or aspirants opted for consensus,” he said, adding: “The data we have shows that the party will participate in the general election in all 47 counties.”  UDA warned that it will disqualify candidates who engage in violence, “especially against women aspirants”.
