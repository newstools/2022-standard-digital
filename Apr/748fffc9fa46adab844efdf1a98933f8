Kenyans’ focus on Thursday will be on Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani as he reads the country’s Sh3.31 trillion budget.     Yatani's motorcade left the Treasury building along Harambee Avenue for Parliament at 2.38 pm under tight security.       This year’s budget is being read two months earlier than its traditional June date to allow for the MPs to approve the expenditure ahead of the August 9 General Election.     The event is also significant as it will be the last budget under President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration.         CS Yatani targets to raise Sh2.14 trillion in taxes and turn to lenders to plug the deficit by borrowing Sh846.1 billion.     Treasury will be tasking the KRA to collect Sh2.14 trillion as ordinary revenues, being Sh341.1 billion more than the Sh1.8 trillion that the taxman was tasked to collect in the current financial year.
