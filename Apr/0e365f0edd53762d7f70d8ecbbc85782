Kenyans living in arid and semi-arid areas will have increased access to clean water, thanks to a partnership between ChildFund International and Davis & Shirtliff.  Three other countries set to benefit are Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia.  The partnership will utilise technology to provide clean and safe water to marginalised and under-resourced communities.  The project involves installation and rehabilitation of boreholes, storage tanks, and electric and solar-powered pumps.    Besides providing water testing technologies and services, the two organisations will implement related interventions in public schools.  “This partnership could not have come at a better time when many communities are reeling from the effects of climate change, manifested by frequent droughts leading to food and water insecurity,” said Chege Ngugi, ChildFund Africa regional director.   He said Covid-19 had shown the importance of clean water in preventing diseases.  Davis & Shirtliff Managing Director Edward Davis said the partnership would "make water affordable and accessible to more people, no matter where they live.”  Already, four boreholes have been drilled and equipped in Samburu and Marsabit to benefit over 30,000 residents, seven schools, two health facilities and animals.   By Collins Kweyu | 5 hours ago By Peterson Githaiga | 5 hours ago By Omelo Juliet | 5 hours ago By Joakim Bwana | 6 hours ago
