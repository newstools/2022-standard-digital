Kuria West and East MP's Mathias Robi and Marwa Kitayama flanked by other Kuria leaders holding dummy Bible on April 8, 2022, during the launch of Kurian Bible at Kehancha stadium Kehancha in Kuria west sub-County.  [Standard]  The Bible Society of Kenya and Tanzania on Friday launched a Bible written in Kuria language after 39 years of scripting.  General Secretary Elizabeth Muriuki and Alfred Kimonge from Tanzania officiated the launch of the Bible at Kehancha Stadium.  Deputy President William Ruto’s wife, Rachael Ruto, graced the launch and distribution of the new Bibles, which will be sold at Sh650 per copy.  “This is a new journey to spiritual transformation and will no doubt change the community’s way of life and look at the world through a different lens,” said Mrs Ruto, adding that the Kuria Bible translation is a major milestone.  MPs Marwa Kitayama (Kuria East) and Mathias Robi (Kuria West) lauded the Bible translation.  Mr Kitayama thanked DP Ruto who in 2013, during a visit to Kuria East, donated Sh3 million for the work. DP Ruto later donated another Sh4 million, with the scripting and review costing a total of Sh35 million.  The money was raised from friends and well-wishers. Mr Kitayama urged the Abakuria people to develop a culture of reading and embracing good morals from the Bible.  MP Robi added: “We want our people to be God-fearing and that is why our leadership made efforts, working closely with the Church leadership to hasten this translation.”  Mr Kimonge said they were pleased with the exercise and urged other communities to push for their own translated Bible.
