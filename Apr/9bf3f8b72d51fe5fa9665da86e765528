Police were called in to control motorists and boda boda riders in most petrol stations along the Nakuru-Nairobi highway, following the biting fuel shortage.  Several cars stalled along the highway with motorists seeking the services of boda boda operators to help them look for fuel.  Most cars stalled a few meters to the petrol station, compounding the already bad situation.  Motorists travelled from Ruaka and Kinungi near Naivasha to look for the commodity in Limuru after word spread that one of the stations in Limuru had petrol.  James Maina whose car stalled at Kimende, approximately 20 kilometres away from Limuru, said he paid a boda boda operator Sh500 for the trip and another 100 shillings to buy a container. “I was traveling from Naivasha to Nairobi I came on hoping to get some petrol along the busy highway to no avail, my car stalled at Kimende, upon enquiring, boda boda riders told me I try Limuru town,” Maina said.  Ben Okoth who was traveling from Kisumu with his family faced the same predicament after his car stalled at Maginain Kiambu County.    Okoth hiked a lift from a truck, bought a plastic container and lined up for several hours in Limuru town to only get five litres of fuel.  He said he left his family by the roadside to fetch fuel.  “I am scared now my wife and two children are by the roadside several kilometres away. My car stalled after I ran out of fuel and there was not a single station that had fuel in Naivasha,” he said.  Okoth said a boda boda rider charged him Sh500 to help him fetch fuel in Limuru. He urged the government to resolve the matter urgently.  By Amos Kareithi | 50 minutes ago By Dominic Omondi | 50 minutes ago By Macharia Kamau | 1 hour ago By Antony Gitonga | 9 hours ago
