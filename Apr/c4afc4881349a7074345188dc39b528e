KNEC CEO Dr David Njengere during the release of the 2021 KCSE results. [Jonah Onyango, Standard]  Registration for the 2022 national examinations and assessment begins today, April 27, and end on May 14, 2022.  The Ministry of Education has released guidelines for registration of Grade Six, Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE), and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams.  School heads are required to ensure that all registered candidates are genuine pupils and students of their respective schools, failure to which the school risks de-registration.  “Registration of any other persons will be treated as an examination malpractice which attracts sanctions against an examination centre, including de-registration of the school,” Kenya National Examination Council CEO David Njeng’ere said. Schools with less than five candidates will not be allowed to register. Instead, Sub County Education Directors (SCDE) will identify examination centres where the candidates will be registered and sit their exams.  Similarly, schools with less than 30 candidates will be hosted as per the set guidelines on hosting of examination centres.  School heads are also required to accurately capture the candidates' details as per the KNEC guidelines and are also required to submit the registration documents to the SCDEs by May 20.  The Ministry also says it will not allow late registration of candidates.  “There will be no late registration of candidates for the 2022 examinations, assessment, and Qualifying Test. All involved parties are therefore advised to observe the set timelines as KNEC will strictly adhere to the same.”  This year’s national exams are scheduled for November.
