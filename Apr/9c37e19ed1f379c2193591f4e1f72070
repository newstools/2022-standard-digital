Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani has proposed a third party policy for Boda Boda and Tuk Tuk riders, in a bid to amend insurance regulations.   While delivering the 2022/23 budget on Thursday, Yatani observed there had been a steady growth of tricycle operators who lacked insurance covers for their passengers.  "The owners of motorcycles do not have insurance covers to cater for any treatment in case of injuries or compensation in case of death or any other damages caused by an accident involving motorcycles," he said.   In this respect, the CS proposed to amend the Insurance Regulations to require motorcycles and three wheelers to take insurance for their passengers.  Yatani's remarks came at a time the government is working to restore sanity in the Boda Boda sector. "What we want to do is reform the sector and weed out criminals who are amongst you and we need your help," Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said last month.   Currently, a registration exercise that will run until June 30, 2022, is ongoing at Huduma centres across the country.  Riders are expected to have the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) PIN certificate, original ID and a phone number in the rider's name to ensure a smooth registration.
