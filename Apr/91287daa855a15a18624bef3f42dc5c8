The hospital was in a sorry state as the workers demanded to be paid before they could resume work.  There were fears that the maternity and the medical and surgical wards could be adversely affected.  Addressing the press yesterday, the 70 workers led by their chairperson Delamare Deya demanded immediate payment. “It is time our employer intervened and paid us as we endure a lot of suffering,” Mr Deya said,  He claimed that their efforts to have the matter addressed have been futile.  “Each time we complain about the unpaid salaries we are threatened with sacking,” Mr Deya said.  The workers accused Governor Zachary Obado's administration of subjecting them to a hostile working environment, with claims of water scarcity at the facility for the last two weeks.  Sunan Libra claimed they could not afford basic needs nor fend for their families.  Dorine Owiti said she could not cater for her medical bills.  Health Executive Kefas Nyamita appealed to the striking workers to be patient as their demands will be addressed. “Plans are underway to ensure that we pay all their dues soon,” Nyamita said.​​  By Mactilda Mbenywe | 5 hours ago By Sharon Owino | 23 hours ago By Phillip Mwakio | 1 day ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago
