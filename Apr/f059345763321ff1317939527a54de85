John Karanja Gachingiri Njoro Ward MCA Aspirant whose UDA nomination certificate was revoked. [Harun Wathari, Standard]  The UDA party is on the spot after it revoked the certificate of a nominee who won the Njoro Ward Nominations in Nakuru County.  John Karanja Gachingiri won the party’s ticket in the April 14 nominations with 2,671 votes and was awarded a provisional certificate.  Susan Nyambura Njuguna, who is a Jubilee Party nominated MCA, came second with 2,080 votes.  Ms Nyambura, who rejected the results, moved to the party headquarters where she filed a petition seeking nullification of the exercise and a repeat of the nominations. The matter was heard by the UDA dispute-resolution committee chaired by Emanuel Mumia.   The committee cancelled its initial decision and directed the returning officer to award the certificate to Ms Nyambura.     By Nzau Musau | 30 minutes ago By Brian Okoth | 1 hour ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 1 hour ago By Brian Otieno | 3 hours ago
