Moes Asman Ali appeared before Mombasa Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku at a Mombasa Court in Mombasa County on Monday, April 11, 2022. [Kelvin Karani, Standard]  A stowaway arrested in the Indian Ocean aboard a ship has asked for forgiveness.  Moes Ali was arrested on April 9 on MV Hoegh Brasilia, a car carrier vessel that was sailing to India from the Port of Mombasa.  Ali told Mombasa Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku that he thought the vessel was traveling to Europe.  The accused pleaded guilty to the charges of failing to report his departure to the nearest Immigration office, and hiding at the ship’s deck number six. “I regret my actions and ask for forgiveness from this court and promise never to repeat the mistake that I have committed,” he told the court.  According to the police report, the accused entered the vessel using the main ramp pretending to be a step door service provider.  The court will sentence him tomorrow.
