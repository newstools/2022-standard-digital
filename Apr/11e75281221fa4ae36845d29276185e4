Azimio la Umoja leader Raila Odinga met with partner party leaders and representatives where the thorny issue of a running mate was discussed.  According to a statement signed by Odinga's campaign spokesperson Professor Makau Mutua the partner parties will deliberate on the matter and make an announcement at an appropriate time.  "The matter of a running mate will be decided in consultation with partner constituent parties at the appropriate time," reads a statement sent to newsrooms by Odinga's campaign spokesperson Professor Makau Mutua.  The leaders also had discussions on inclusivity, equity and consultation with an aim of guiding and anchoring the coalition party ahead of the August 9, elections.  They resolved to expand the Coalition Council and the top organ of Azimio to 11 members. Additionally, they concluded there would be no zoning of the country for any political party and party organs will not include caucuses or alliances.  The announcement came a day after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka expressed optimism at clinching the running mate position.  "We are eyeing the running mate position. We don't want to talk about the obvious," he said during the launch of the Wiper People Living with Disabilities organ in Nairobi.  Jubilee leaders from Mt Kenya have, however, expressed a contradicting view.  Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu opined the running mate position should go to the Mt Kenya region so as to attract the electorate to vote for Odinga.  "He [Kalonzo] has been Odinga's running mate twice and they did not get to where they were going. It is difficult to imagine that if he becomes the running mate again, they will get to where they are going," Wambugu said.
