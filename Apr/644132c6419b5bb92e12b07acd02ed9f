The late KEBS North Eastern Regional Manager Ahmed Antar [Courtesy]  At the wee hours of Sunday, KEBS North Eastern Regional Manager Ahmed Antar and his twin daughters left their Garissa home for Mombasa.  Antar was driving his twins for an interview at the Sheikh Khalifa Secondary School in Mombasa.  They had scored over 400 marks in the 2021 KCPE and were hoping to secure a slot at Sheikh Khalifa, a school that prides itself on academic excellence and a strong Islamic foundation.  Unbeknownst to them, however, their dreams would be shuttered in a road accident in Hola on the Mombasa-Garissa Highway. The trio went to Sheikh Khalifa and the twins did the interview.  But on their way back, Dertu division chief Mohamed Buul, who is also a close friend of the family told the Standard that Antar’s car hit a lorry, killing all those on board.  "In total, there were five people in the vehicle because Antar [the deceased] had offered a lift to two more people," Buul said.  Buul mourned Antar as a generous, caring and God-fearing man.  Bodies are being preserved at the Garissa County Referral Hospital mortuary ahead of burial tomorrow morning.  Antar is survived by his wife, a nurse at Garissa County and four other children.  Nominated Senator Iman Falhada has joined numerous Kenyans who have sent their condolences to the family and friends of the trio.  "My heartfelt condolences to family and friends, my brother and his two daughters died in a grisly road accident that happened in Hola near Mombasa-Garissa Highway. Inallilah waina illahi rajiun," Iman wrote on Facebook.
