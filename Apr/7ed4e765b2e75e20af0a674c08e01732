A decision by the UDA tribunal to have Emgwen parliamentary nomination results in Nandi County recounted sparked off protests yesterday.  Residents took to the streets of Kapsabet and blocked the Eldoret-Kisumu highway demanding a repeat, saying the exercise was marred with malpractices.  During last Thursday's polls that attracted 11 contestants, two top contenders, Woman Rep Dr. Tecla Tum and Joses Lelmengit, disputed marked ballot papers from four polling stations which they alleged were manipulated. Youths in support of Mr Lelmengit are said to have destroyed ballot boxes over claims there were plans to sneak them into the tallying centre.  Mr Lelmengit was announced the winner and handed the nominee interim certificate. Emgwen returning officer Peter Rono called for a repeat nomination instead of a recount.    By Nzau Musau | 30 minutes ago By Brian Okoth | 1 hour ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 1 hour ago By Brian Otieno | 3 hours ago
