One of the two petitioners in the case seeking to block former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko from contesting the governorship in Mombasa is seeking to withdraw the matter from the court.  Two voters, Ndoro Kaguyu and George Odhiambo, filed the petition seeking orders to block the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission from accepting the nomination of Sonko as a candidate for the Mombasa governor seat.  Kayuga and Odhiambo, through lawyer Willis Oluga of Oluga and Company Advocates, wanted the High Court to issue conservatory orders restraining the IEBC from clearing Sonko, the candidate of Wiper party, ahead of the August elections. The matter is before High Court judge John Mativo.  Before the court could issue directions on how the petition would proceed, Kaguya applied to withdraw the matter through his newly appointed lawyer Titus Kirui, who said Kaguya was no longer interested in pursuing the petition.
