Dr Kambona, Kajwang’, Ochieng’ and Kalosi are battling for the ODM party ticket. Mr Kojo, a human rights activist, is vying as an independent candidate.

I am coming up with fresh ideas for fighting corruption,” said Mr Ojanga.  The vice-chairman attributed lapses in service delivery in the county to lack of proper oversight.  Homa Bay County is a stronghold of ODM party. But Mr Ojanga said this will not impede his senatorial endeavours.
