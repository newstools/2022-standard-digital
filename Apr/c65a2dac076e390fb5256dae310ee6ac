Pupils at Bidii Primary School in Nairobi in their classroom on January 4, 2020 [Stafford Ondego, Standard]  Schools reopen countrywide today for a new academic year. But it is not a 12-month year as it used to be. The academic year is expected to end in December and by January next year, all learners are expected to move to the next class.  There is no doubt that Covid-19 has upended all facets of our lives. However, the speed at which our children are being taken through the syllabus leaves a lot to be desired. It makes many people to question the wisdom of Education ministry's to fast-track learning following the initial pandemic scare. The massive failure witnessed in the 2021 KCSE exams is perhaps a product of the hasty implementation of the syllabus.  As they go back to class, the government should ensure the time at hand is enough for learners to absorb everything they are supposed to during an academic year.
