A man suspected of online fraud has been arrested at his Ongata Rongai home.  According to a statement by DCI on Twitter, Bob Nyongesa is said to have been posing as a white woman by the name Ryan Britney to defraud unsuspecting Kenyans.  In a recent case, Nyongesa posed as a prospective vehicle buyer on a popular online site and had been conversing with the vehicle owner known as Ali before defrauding of Sh150,000.  "He [Nyongesa] expressed willingness to buy the motor vehicle, a sleek Mercedes Benz at Sh1.4 million. He requested for more photos of the vehicle posted on the online platform, before traveling to Nairobi where they would seal the deal.  "Convinced that the prospective client was a serious buyer, Ali sent him more photos including the interior and other parts of the machine," read an excerpt of the statement posted by DCI. Nyongesa would contact the vehicle owner to inform him that he had hit several cows and goats belonging to Masai herdsmen and needed some money.  At the time, Nyongesa was posing as a woman and said the herdsmen were on the verge of lynching him if he failed to pay Sh 150,000.  "In a well scripted lie, Nyongesa sent Ali images of livestock carcasses sprawled on a road and his purportedly damaged vehicle.  "He appealed to Ali to send the money and promised to refund once he accessed her bank in the capital as he made payments for the vehicle."  But as soon as Ali sent him the money, Nyongesa did not answer to any of his calls.  DCI says the suspect has had previous run-ins with the law. He is being held at the Langata police station pending arraignment tomorrow morning.  Items collected from his house include; several SIM cards, laptops and mobile phones.
