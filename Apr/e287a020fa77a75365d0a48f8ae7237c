Jubilee Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni and Governor Francis Kimemia during a meeting with aspirants in Ol Kalou yesterday. [James Munyeki, Standard]  More than 100 Jubilee Party aspirants in Nyandarua have resolved to back Governor Francis Kimemia's re-election bid.  The aspirants yesterday said Kimemia was best placed to face the UDA candidate based on his experience.   “Even our rivals in UDA are afraid of his candidacy as they're aware of how strong he is,” said Rev Moses Ndegwa, who is seeking the senator's seat, at Ol Kalou town during a meeting of aspirants with the party's national officials. “As aspirants, all we ask for is a transparent exercise where voters will be allowed to freely express their will," he added.  Former Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki is also seeking the party ticket in the race for the governor's seat.   Party Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni assured those aspiring for various seats of free and fair nominations.  Mr Kioni said the party has no preferred candidates. "The party will support those picked during the nominations all the way to the elections," he said. "The position I hold demands that I remain neutral. We want the best candidates to win.”  Kioni also called on members to continue popularising the party. "Some people are claiming that our party is dead. Going by the number of candidates Jubilee Party has attracted in the Mt Kenya region, you realise the claim that the party is dead is false,” said Kioni.  Kimemia asked aspirants to remain united even after the nominations.
