Nyandarua County Assembly Speaker Ndegwa Wahome has moved to court to challenge the revocation of his nomination certificate to vie for the county's governor seat by the Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) party.  This was after the Moses Kuria-led party last week annulled his nomination certificate, barely two weeks after handing it to him, and announced its support for the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate Ndirangu Badilisha. Wahome has now filed a petition at the Political Parties Tribunal where he sought to have the decision by the party’s top brass reversed and have his name on the ballot under the CCK party in the forthcoming August elections.  In the petition, the Speaker noted that he was neither consulted nor involved in any form by the party to discuss the issue of his candidature and the decision to withdraw from the gubernatorial race in Nyandarua County. He termed the party’s actions in bad taste, draconian further noting that they were not founded in the constitution, the nomination rules or the coalition agreement of the party with the Kenya Kwanza Coalition.  “…the effect of the impugned decision is to unlawfully strip off, disadvantage and extinguish the complainant’s candidature for the gubernatorial position in Nyandarua County under the respondent’s ticket,” read the petition in part.  Wahome said he moved to court was after failed attempts to get the party leadership to address his predicament amicably.
