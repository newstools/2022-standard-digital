The fuel shortage crisis in Kenya seems to be worsening by the hour.  Several fueling stations across the country have experienced crowds of motorists hoping to fill their tanks.  The crisis according to industry players has been fueled by the government’s debt to oil marketing companies, as it tried to stabilise oil prices. This is said to have denied the companies money to import petroleum products, hence the shortage.    However, President Uhuru Kenyatta is reported to have signed the Supplementary Appropriation Bill this afternoon, paving way for the release of Sh34.4 billion to oil marketing companies.  Here are some photos of the crisis in fueling stations across the county: Long queue at Shell petrol station in Nakuru.
