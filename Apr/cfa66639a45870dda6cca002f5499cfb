Judges yesterday rejected a proposal to subject them to fresh vetting, describing the exercise as stressful, intimidating and unfair to judicial officers.   Speaking during the Judges Colloquium in Mombasa, Supreme Court judge Isaac Lenaola said frequent vetting of judges and magistrates could erode Kenyans' confidence in the Judiciary.  In 2003, all judges were vetted by Justice (retired) Aaron Ringera-led committee. A number of judges were sent home in what was described as a radical surgery.  Eight years later, after the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution, all the judges and magistrates again underwent individual screening that was referred to as vetting.  In the two exercises, some judges and magistrates were sent home over alleged integrity issues. Others have however been cleared of any wrong doing.  Yesterday, Lenaola chided presidential candidates promising Kenyans another round of vetting of judicial officers if they win the August 9 General Election.   “For how long will the judges be vetted? We are tired of being vetted. The previous ones were stressful, intimidating and unfair,” said Justice Lenaola as he was applauded by the judges.  The judges were meeting members of the parliamentary Justice and Legal Affairs Committee led by Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang' and his Homa Bay Town counterpart Peter Kaluma.  Kaluma said good judges like retired Justice Samuel Bosire, Justice Otieno Kwach, Justice Omolo Riaga and others were unfairly removed from office.  “We are missing these great judges in the corridors of justice,” said Kaluma, adding that he will ask Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya not to use the same tactics again.  Tharaka  MP George Gitonga Murugara, who is allied to Deputy President William Ruto, said UDA presidential candidate has not floated a proposal to vet judges afresh.
