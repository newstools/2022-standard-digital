Suleiman Shahbal and his allies are demanding free and fair primaries. [Omondi Onyango, Standard]  Confusion continues to mar the ODM nominations at the Coast after some aspirants were handed direct tickets in Nairobi amid protests by rival camps.  In Mombasa County, governor aspirant Suleiman Shahbal and his allies yesterday demanded free and fair primaries and rejected consensus being fronted by the ODM National Elections Board (NEB).    The party primaries were set for today but have been postponed to allow time for further consultations as anxiety heightens in the Shahbal and Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir camps. In Taita Taveta County, several ODM aspirants for various elective positions have been given direct tickets. Those who have benefited from direct tickets did not have opponents to be subjected to in the primaries.  In Kilifi County, there was confusion in Malindi as supporters of politicians from various political parties want nominations carried out while others want their candidates given direct tickets.  Those in support of direct tickets argue that their leaders have been loyal to their parties hence no need to subject them to party primaries.  Meanwhile, in the Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) party associated with Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, supporters want their candidates given direct tickets.
