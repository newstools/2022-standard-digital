Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi. [David Njaaga, Standard]  National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has given Wajir Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi two days to table evidence on allegations that Deputy President William Ruto was involved in questionable land deals.  The debate during the afternoon session yesterday was triggered by a petition by a Coast resident seeking Parliament’s intervention to end the delay of title deeds for the people of Msambweni.  Garissa Township MP Aden Duale promised that Kenya Kwanza would resolve the land problem. "We are not land grabbers and we will resolve that issue. We know you know who stole your land," he said.  But Gedi accused Ruto of being involved in shady land deals. "When we talk about land grabbing we know the people that grab land in this country including the land that belongs to the students of Lang'ata Road Primary School and we know the person that grabbed that land," she said. Mr Muturi asked her to table the evidence on Thursday.        By Peterson Githaiga | 2 hours ago By Isaiah Gwengi and Olivia Odhiambo | 9 hours ago By Victor Nzuma | 9 hours ago By Nathan Ochunge | 9 hours ago
