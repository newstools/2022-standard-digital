Comedian Jasper Muthomi, popularly known as MC Jessy, will vie for the South Imenti parliamentary seat on an Independent ticket.  Jessy previously sought to vie for the seat under the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party.   He, however, dropped out of the race in favour of Mwiti Kathaara after Deputy President William Ruto brokered a deal between the duo.  "MC Jessy will join the presidential campaign team after postponing his parliamentary bid in favour of Mwiti Kathaara for the South Imenti Seat,” said Ruto on April 13, 2022.  But in an announcement by Jessy on Monday, April 18, he says he is determined to be on the ballot come August 9, elections. "Sent like an arrow from a mighty man’s hand. We keep going. Bado Tuko kwa race (We are still in the race). Let’s do this South Imenti, 9th August it is," he said. The comedian, nontheless, noted that he would still be supporting the Deputy President for the presidential seat.
