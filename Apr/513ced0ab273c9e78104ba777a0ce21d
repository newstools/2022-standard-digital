A Kiambu court has extended the detention of a student in connection with the killing of a taxi driver.   The Kenya Certificate Secondary Education (KCSE) candidate and two others were arrested in connection with the death of Stephen Kimani, 40, in Kericho County.  Court papers claim the trio had planned and executed the killing after they lured the Uber driver by promising to pay Sh30,000 as transport costs to Kisii on February 12.  Kiambu Deputy Registrar Wilson Radin ordered that mental assessments be undertaken on two accused at Kiambu Level 5 hospital to determine fitness to take plea. “Initially this was a robbery with violence case, but since the victim is now deceased, it is now a murder case. I order the other two accused to be taken for mental assessment,” the registrar said.  The case will be mentioned on April 13.
