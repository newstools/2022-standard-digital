Women leaders allied to Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga want Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua to be his running mate.  The women, drawn from 26 parties allied to Azimio la Umoja, were speaking during a meeting held today at the Jacaranda Hotel in Westlands, Nairobi County.  The group described Karua as an experienced leader who had a proven track record in her service delivery to Kenyans.  "She is a national figure and has vied for presidency before. Martha has been a minister, she knows how to run government," said Youth and Gender Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Rachel Shebesh.  Shebesh added; "Martha is a committed woman, she is known for integrity and resoluteness. We are going to start that serious conversation in Azimio [la Umoja] that we think the number two should be Martha Karua."   On her part, Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu said Kenyan women ought to have an equal share in the next government.  Last month, Karua announced she would support Raila's bid in the August 9 General Election.  "I have chosen to be with Raila without struggle. We've been in the trenches together and from today we shall be going out to popularize the Azimio la Umoja coalition and his 10-point agenda," Karua said.  Other leaders who are hoping to be considered for the running mate position in Azimo la Umoja are Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth.  Speaking during a church service on Sunday, April 17, Kalonzo maintained that he has to be on Odinga's ticket.  "Why would you want my brother Raila to end up being president and his running mate twice is out? Take it to the bank, I am in the decision making team,” Kalonzo said.
