Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja. [David Njaaga, Standard]   Governor Granton Samboja wants voters in Taila-Taveta County to re-elect him so that he can complete projects he initiated.  The governor is defending his seat on the Jubilee Party ticket. In 2017, he flew the Wiper party ticket and won against the ODM wave in the region.  “I have done a lot to improve access to education and clean drinking water. We have also developed agriculture and we intend to do more,” said Governor Samboja.  Some of the projects the governor cited are the Sh98 million Nyangoro water project in Maktau, Mwatate, which is expected to benefit more than 17,000 residents. Also in the list is a medical oxygen bulk storage plant at the Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi, among others.  He faces 14 aspirants including former governor John Mruttu of UDA, former Senator Dan Mwazo (Wiper) and Mwatate MP Andrew Mwadime of CPK.  Others are lawyer Stephen Mwakesi (PEP), George Mwandembo (DAP-K), Patience Nyange (Narc), Elijah Mwandoe (PAA), Thomas Mwakwida (ODM), Faustine Mghendi (TSP), Onesmus Mwinzi (ANC), Rachel Mwakazi Skjaerpe (Jubilee) and Mwaita Mlaghacho.  Jubilee Party is a member of the Azimio La Umoja coalition whose presidential flag bearer is ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kalonzo Musyoka’s Wiper party is also part of the movement.
