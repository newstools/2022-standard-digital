Sections of Nairobi County have been listed among places that will experience dry taps for 24 hours beginning Thursday morning.  The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC) attributed the water supply interruption to the ongoing construction of the Expressway around Uhuru Highway.  “This will facilitate interconnection of the relocated new and old water pipes along Uhuru Highway,” reads the statement by NCWSC Managing Director Dr Nahashon Muguna.  The water disruption will enable the release of the road corridor to the Expressway contractor between Haile Selassie Avenue and University Way junction.  The disruption will start on Thursday, April 14 at 6.00 am until Friday, April 15 at 6.00 am. Other places that will experience water disruption include Parklands, areas along Limuru Road, Aga-Khan Hospital, the University of Nairobi’s Parklands Campus areas along Mombasa Road including South B and C.  In Eastlands, the affected estates include Buruburu, City Stadium, Maringo, Bahati and the whole Industrial Area.  Also listed are Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, EPZ-Athi-River and Coca-cola Factory in Nairobi.  The expressway starts at Mlolongo and cuts through the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Nairobi’s CBD ending at Westlands along Waiyaki Way.  The government is currently conducting test runs on the road ahead of the commissioning of the expressway by President Uhuru Kenyatta expected in the next few weeks.
