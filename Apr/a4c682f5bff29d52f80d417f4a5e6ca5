Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has opened up on frequent fights between him and his ODM counterpart Raila Odinga during the grand coalition government headed by the late former president Mwai Kibaki.  At the time, Odinga was serving as a Prime Minister following the contentious outcome of the 2007 presidential election while Kalonzo was the Vice President.  The two would often rub shoulders, with each trying to show their might on who was the second most powerful man in the country as well as the designate leader of government business.  But Kalonzo says he played his part as a gentleman.  "I remember one time; I think it was on Jamuhuri Day. Normally, the motorcade would come from State House...the question was who should go immediately before President Kibaki in order to receive him. Was it going to be me or was it going to be Raila. "The issue was picked by the media that there was a protocol hitch," Kalonzo said during an exclusive interview on KTN News on Tuesday, April 27.  For the sake of unity in the country, Kalonzo says he decided to back down and take third place.  Kibaki died aged 90 on April 22, 2022.  Kalonzo, who served him for five years, mourns Kibaki as an iconic figure.  "Kibaki is an iconic father figure in this nation; I had the singular privilege of serving as the vice president. There are very few leaders even in the African continent with the spirit of selflessness and a singular sense of purpose to their people," he stated.  "He would get the nation laughing by using language that young Kenyans would not be allowed to use,” said Musyoka.  Kibaki will be buried on Saturday, April 30 in Othaya, Nyeri County.
