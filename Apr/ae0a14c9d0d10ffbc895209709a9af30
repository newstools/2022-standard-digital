Some MPs in Murang’a County have suffered a big blow after their allies, who were seeking the UDA ticket, lost in the party primaries.   Kandara MP Alice Wahome, for instance, had three of her allies – two of whom are nominated MCAs – lose the nomination.  Nominated MCA Lucy Nyambura Ngugi who was seeking the party’s ticket in the woman rep race lost to Betty Maina, who decamp to UDA two months to the primaries.  “I concede defeat and wish my competitor well in the August polls. We live to fight another day,” Ms Nyambura said.  Ms Maina polled 85,205 votes, Ms Nyambura garnered 28,097, while Rebecca Waruguru was third with 20,264 votes. At Kagunduini ward, Samson Mukora defeated nominated MCA Diana Muthoni, also a close ally of Ms Wahome.  Mr Mukora, a graduate of mechanical engineering from Technical University of Mombasa, said he has been campaigning in the villages.  “It has been tough looking for votes while working,” he said.    Mr Mukora occasionally campaigned on boda boda as he ferried passengers. In Ithiru Ward, Laban Thuo, who worked at Ms Wahome’s office, had his ambitions cut short by a little known Naomi Maina.  In Maragua Constituency, Sarah Njeri, a nominated MCA and ally of MP Mary Wamaua lost the UDA ticket for Ichagaki Ward to Hillary Muigai.  In Kiharu Constituency’s Wangu Ward, Patrick Gichini trounced Isaac Kamote, who was vying for the third time.  Others who were floored include MCAs Esther Kamau of Gaturi and Duncan Muturi of Mbiri, who are allies of Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro. Kamau was elected in December 2019 on People’s Empowerment Party, which was then associated with Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria.
