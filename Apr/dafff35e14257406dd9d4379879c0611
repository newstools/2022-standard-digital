ODM leader Raila Odinga’s key ally and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed is to be given a direct ticket as he faces no opponent for the seat on the party ticket.  Also set to benefit from direct nomination is Rongo MP Paul Abuor. Migori ODM branch chairman Philip Makabongo and the county committee in charge of nominations secretary Joseph Amenya said Mr Mohamed and Mr Abuor had no competitors for their seats.  “The other seats in Migori have several aspirants and none has built a consensus to step down for others despite several attempts at the party and opinion polls,” Amenya said while speaking to the aspirants.  ODM is to hold its nominations in Migori on Monday. Mr Makabongo castigated aspirants who have been attacking the party over nominations and issuing statements against Raila’s presidency through their supporters.  “We have urged the aspirants to maintain peace. We have been meeting with them over the nomination exercise and there is no way the process will be flawed,” Makabongo said.
