A section of leaders in Bomet has demanded the calling off of the UDA primaries in the county after marked ballot papers were found being transported to various polling stations.  Former Petroleum and Mining CAS John Mosonik, Nominated MP Wilson Sossion, Bomet senator Christopher Langat and Bomet Women Representative Joyce Korir said there was no need for the exercise to continue while hundreds of marked ballot papers had already been dispatched.  The leaders claimed there was a plan to rig the process in favour of three aspirants.   Mrs Korir said several vehicles were impounded ferrying the marked papers with three people being arrested.  Senator Langat accused the presiding offers saying they failed to exercise transparency in the exercise.  “Those send to the county to oversee the process were compromised from the onset and that is why they wanted to rig for the three,” Langat claimed.  Mosonik said there was no need to continue with the process due to the discrepancies.  He said those who will be elected if the process is allowed to continue will be deemed to have been rigged.  Drama unfolded at the county tallying centre after the leaders stormed to demand answers from the County Returning officer Ronald Mutai.  Mutai however dispelled the claims of rigging saying goons disrupted the process.  He said as early as 2.00 am officers taking polling materials were attacked by rowdy youth who destroyed them.  Mutai said voting was going on in other sub-counties smoothly except in Bomet Central where polling materials for 4 polling stations were destroyed.  The leaders have however disputed the claims by the CRO saying that marked ballot papers were spreading fear.  Sossion said they will not accept the outcome until a new date is given.  He said there is not going to be any harm to postpone the nomination exercise.
