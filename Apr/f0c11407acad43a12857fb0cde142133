Education CS George Magoha has revealed a list of schools that are most preferred by candidates who sat the 2021 KCPE examination.  The candidates who wrote their examinations a month ago are set to join Form One in their respective schools on May 3.  Among the most preferred secondary schools are Nanyuki High School, Kabianga High School and Pangani Girls respectively among others.  The Ministry revealed some 1,225,502 candidates sat for the examinations whose results were released a fortnight ago, and have all been placed in the 9,200 public schools across the country.  While releasing the Form One placement results in Nairobi on Monday morning, Prof Magoha said some 10 schools had received applications of over ten times their capacity. “It became clear to us that a big number of candidates did not receive proper guidance and direction when choosing schools. This resulted in some schools attracting far many applicants against their capacities,” the CS said.  For instance, Nanyuki High School, the most selected school in this year’s selection, has a capacity of 480 but got 156, 003 candidates selecting it.  Kabianga High School, one of the top schools in Kericho County, has a capacity of 528 but got 149, 087 candidates picking it as their choice.  Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha.

Moreover, Magoha also commended two schools in the Nyanza Region that went out of their way to expand capacity in support of 100 per cent transition.  “St. Albert Ulanda Girls and Sironga Girls are going to admit 864 and 816 candidates respectively,” Magoha noted.

Then directed, “Ensure that parents and/or guardians with learners who will be joining Form One are not overburdened with unnecessary requirements that increase the cost of education. Principals should exercise caution while listing student 11 requirements as part of the measures to reduce the cost of education. Some of the items to be avoided include Exercise books, Class readers/novels, Photocopying papers, Full scalps, Atlas, Mathematical tables, Hockey sticks, pangas, jembes slashers, hand brushes among others,”.
