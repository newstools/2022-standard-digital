Dissatisfaction and protests have continued to rock the UDA nominations in Deputy President William Ruto’s backyard.  Uasin Gishu governor aspirant Julius Bitok Sunday called for the rejection of all the results from the county, claiming the nominations were marred by irregularities.  “We reject the results because we believe the nominations were rigged in favour of certain candidates. We are aware of many malpractices and it started with the appointment of presiding officers and clerks, which was done by certain candidates,” said Prof Bitok.    The former ambassador said the party’s national elections board should take immediate action, clear the mess and order fresh nominations. “There will be no negotiation and we shall not allow to be intimidated. We demand free and fair nominations. The party has the machinery to detect anomalies,” he said.  Residents of Kaptarakwa, Keiyo South, in Elgeyo Marakwet County protested a move where an MCA aspirant was reportedly declared the winner but the certificate was given to another candidate.  The residents staged a demonstration Sunday morning, blocking the Nyaru-Iten road for the better part of the day.  They said Matthew Cheruiyot was declared the winner with 2,235 votes while his closest rival Meshack Kiplagat came second with 1,704 votes.  However, they claim the certificate was given to Mr Kiplagat instead. Cheruiyot said he had launched an official complaint to the party’s elections board.  In Nandi, governor candidate Antipas Tirop dismissed the nomination as “shambolic and marred with irregularities”.  “We reject the results for the gubernatorial seat in totality because it does not reflect the will of the people,” said Mr Tirop. Keiyo South MP Daniel Rono however said he had conceded defeat.   By Stephanie Wangari | 3 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 4 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 4 hours ago By Eric Abuga | 6 hours ago
