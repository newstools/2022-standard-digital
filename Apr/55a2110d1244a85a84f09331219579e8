Machakos County governor aspirant Nzioka Waita makes his speech during his meeting with Machakos County women groups at Gelian hotel in Machakos town on February 11, 2022. [John Muia, Standard]  An aspirant for the Machakos governor’s seat has promised to revive the county’s fortunes.  Speaking at the Machakos Boys High School during a prayers day, former State House Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita said his priority would be to fight poverty and corruption.  “Florence (Mwangangi) and I will offer a better and worthy leadership that will improve service delivery,” he said, adding that he will not lie by promising the impossible.  His administration will also focus on agriculture, health and water services. Bishop Joseph Mutungi of Machakos ACK Diocese led an interdenominational service to bless Mr Waita and his running mate.  Ms Mwangangi said she chose to step down for Mr Waita after consultations.    “When l realised l have many things in common with Waita l bit the bullet and agreed to pair with him for the sake of true change,” she said.  The county assembly Speaker promised voters that their leadership will not disappoint.  “We will bring true change for people of Machakos through servant leadership,” she said.  Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Francis Atwoli Atwoli, through a phone call, urged the people of Machakos to vote for Mr Waita, saying he was the most suitable.
