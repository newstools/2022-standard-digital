A primary school teacher is suspected to have committed suicide after killing his five-year-old son in Kothidha location.  Calvince Okello’s body was today found dangling from the roof of a local church house with a rope tied around his neck.  The boy’s body was later found in a nearby sugarcane plantation. He had injuries on the neck.  Kothidha Chief John Omamo said Okello left home with his son, Charles Norbert, on Monday for a walk in the village. But the teacher’s family got concerned in the evening when they did not return home. His wives reached him on phone and he promised to return home.  “When he was called, he told his family that he would be back home after a few minutes, but he did not,” Mr Omamo said.     By Harold Odhiambo | 9 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo | 15 hours ago By Stanley Ongwae | 3 days ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 5 days ago
