Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria. [David Njaaga, Standard]  Moses Kuria's Chama Cha Kazi has suffered a blow following the resignation of party's deputy organising secretary Peter Muchendu.  He cited serious violation of party's constitution and frustration meted on aspirants for his resignation. In a letter to Mr Kuria, the party secretary general, and copied to Registrar of Political Parties, Muchendu said members have been shortchanged.  Muchendu said when he joined the party, he believed the young people had finally gotten a vehicle that would house their ideas and ideals as opposed to how much they can fork out.  “As a member of the executive committee, I recruited so many of my friends vying for different positions in their respective counties. They went ahead to pay their nomination fees and surrendered all their paper works as advertised by the party's elections board,” Muchendu said Muchendu added that without any approval or consultation from the party executive committee, the party introduced high membership fees.
