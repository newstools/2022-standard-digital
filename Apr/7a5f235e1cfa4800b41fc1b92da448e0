The recent discovery of plastics in human blood should renew Kenya and the world's resolve to get rid of plastics.  The plastic traces, about 140 times smaller,  than a human hair were found by researchers in blood samples of 22 healthy people, according to a study published in Environmental International.  The researchers suspect the plastics got into the bloodstreams of these people via air, food and water.  The dangers of plastics on land and sea are apparent to all. Kenya set a good example by banning plastic bags in 2017. Many countries have since followed suit. Sadly, Kenya has not been strictly enforcing the ban and plastic bags are still in circulation.   We must do more to fully eliminate plastics that continue to such life out of humans and animals.
