MPs Junet Mohamed, Babu Owino, and John Mbadi arrive at DCI Headquarters in Kiambu for questioning. [Emmanuel Too, Standard]  Members of Parliament Junet Mohamed (Suna East), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), and John Mbadi (Suba South) now want Deputy President William Ruto to record a statement on the Raila chopper stoning.  The three recorded witness statements at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters in Kiambu on Tuesday.  Junet said they expect the police to expedite the investigations and bring the culprits to book.  “We gave them information I hope will be useful in their investigations over the recent stoning of Raila Odinga chopper in Uasin Gishu. We expect the expeditious conclusion of this matter,” he said. Earlier, we reported that the trio recorded witness statements on last week’s Raila helicopter stoning.  They were accompanied by other lawmakers including Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina, Gladys Wanga, and others.    Yesterday, Soy and Kapseret MPs Caleb Kositany and Oscar Sudi presented themselves at the Rift Valley Regional DCI headquarters in Nakuru, over their alleged role in the stoning of Raila’s chopper.  DCI, in a statement Saturday said investigations into the incident suggested the three had a role in planning the chaos.  “At the closure of the ceremony, chaos erupted and stones including other projectiles were hurled at Raila by incited youth, maliciously damaging his helicopter’s windscreen,” police said.  Seventeen people have been arraigned in court in connection with the incident.     By Stephanie Wangari | 5 hours ago By Stephanie Wangari | 6 hours ago By George Maringa | 7 hours ago By Standard Reporter | 8 hours ago
