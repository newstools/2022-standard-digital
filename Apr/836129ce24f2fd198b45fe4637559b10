The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal has issued an injunction to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party against recognising Njoro MP Charity Kathambi as its candidate for the seat.  The tribunal has also stopped the party from submitting Kathambi’s name to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as its nominee in the August 9 general elections. This follows a petition filed by John Kariuki Kaniaru, an aspirant who disputed the April 14 nomination exercise and its results claiming it was marred with irregularities and illegalities.  “I went to the UDAs party’s tribunal and didn’t get justice. I moved to the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal with the same complaints and the matter is now at an advanced stage,” said Kaniaru.   In his application under Certificate of Urgency, Kaniaru sought orders staying the decision by the UDA party and its internal tribunal from declaring her as the UDA nominated candidate. The deadline for submission of the list of candidates by political parties to the IEBC was set for April 28, giving Kaniaru a reprieve.  By Ali Abdi | 4 hours ago By Standard Reporter | 4 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 6 hours ago By James Wanzala | 7 hours ago
