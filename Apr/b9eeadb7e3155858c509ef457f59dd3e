Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has ordered three legislators to appear at its Rift Valley offices, over their alleged role in the stoning of Raila Odinga’s chopper.  MPs Caleb Kositany (Soy), Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), and Uasin Gishu County Assembly Speaker David Kiplagat are required to present themselves before the Rift Valley DCI Regional coordinator tomorrow, Sunday at 9 am.  DCI, in a statement Saturday said investigations into the incident suggested the three had a role in planning the chaos.   “At the closure of the ceremony, chaos erupted and stones including other projectiles were hurled at Raila by incited youth, maliciously damaging his helicopter’s windscreen,” police said. Soy MP Caleb Kositany. [Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  The incident occurred on Friday evening during the burial of Mzee Jackson Kibor at his Kabenes home in Soy Sub-County, Uasin Gishu County.  Fourteen people have since been arrested in connection with the incident and will be arraigned on Monday, April 4 once investigations are concluded.  Leaders across the political divide have condemned the stoning incident, calling for a speedy probe and prosecution of the perpetrators.  Deputy President William Ruto termed it unfortunate saying: “I want to apologise to Raila Odinga for what happened to him yesterday. It was unfortunate and I hope those who engaged in this exercise regret what they did.”      By Lee Mwiti Mukunga | 49 minutes ago By Boniface Gikandi | 1 hour ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 1 hour ago By Edward Kosut | 1 hour ago
