Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia has thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for awarding him the Jubilee party ticket to defend his seat.  Mr Kimemia was issued the ticket after a protracted political battle with former Water Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki.  There was a deadlock over who between the governor and Ms Kariuki should fly the Jubilee flag in Nyandarua governor race.  The matter was referred to President Kenyatta for arbitration after the party failed to give the incumbent the nomination certificate last week. On Friday last week, Jubilee Party Election Board Chairperson Stephen Wandeto and Director for Elections Kanini Kega issued nomination certificates to all aspirants in the Mount Kenya region except Nyandarua governor aspirants.   "I thank the party leader President Kenyatta for being fair, on the ground, the pollsters have placed me ahead by 10 points and I am sure of the victory on the August 9 General Election," said Mr Kimemia.  He invited his rivals to join hands with him and forge a common force to ensure victory.  Kimemia will face off with UDA's Moses Kiarie alias Badilisha.
