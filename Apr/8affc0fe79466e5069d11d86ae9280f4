Nairobi Governor aspirant Bishop Margaret Wanjiru has shelved her ambition for Johnson Sakaja.   Sakaja will now run for the Nairobi governor seat on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket, while Wanjiru will run for the Senator seat.  The two reached a consensus after Deputy President William Ruto brokered a deal on Saturday at a Kenya Kwanza meeting in Karen, Nairobi.   “We have identified a team that will give us the best prospects in Nairobi, hence the Kenya kwanza team will be fielding Sakaja as governor candidate,” the DP announced.   Ruto expressed confidence in Sakaja’s ability saying he has demonstrated his leadership capabilities and diligence as a person.  The Nairobi Senator (Sakaja) on his part thanked Wanjiru for what “must have been a difficult decision”, terming the UDA Nairobi governor and senator hopefuls a formidable team.   Other senatorship aspirants including Karen Nyamu, Lucheli and musician Rufftone have also ceded ground in favour of Bishop Wanjiru.   This now quiets down a brewing standoff between Sakaja and Wanjiru that had threatened to split UDA’s Nairobi vote.   Sakaja will be up against the incumbent governor Anne Kananu, Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi, former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, businesswoman Agnes Kagure and Kenya Chamber of Commerce president Richard Ngatia.
