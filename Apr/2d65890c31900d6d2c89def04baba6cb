Raila Odinga’s chopper was damaged in Soy, Uasin Gishu County on April 1, 2022. [Standard]  Fifteen out of the 17 people suspected to have pelted ODM leader Raila Odinga’s helicopter with stones were yesterday freed for lack of evidence.  It was a reprieve for the 15 after the investigating team led by Richard Polo told the Magistate’s court that there is no evidence linking them to the offense. They were set free after appearing before Eldoret Senior Resident Magistrate Emily Kigen.  However, two of the suspects Abednego Kiptanui Kemboi and Kenneth Kipkogei Sawe were arraigned in court charged with malicious damage to property, willfully and unlawfully destroying an aircraft and creating disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace.  Appearing before Senior Principal Magistrate Richard Odenyo,  Kemboi and Sawe denied the charges and were released on a Sh300,000 bond. The first count said they willfully and unlawfully destroyed an aircraft.   By Brian Okoth | 42 minutes ago By Brian Okoth | 1 hour ago By Amos Kareithi | 6 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 6 hours ago
