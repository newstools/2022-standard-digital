Comedian Jasper Muthomi, popularly known as MC Jessy, has dropped his South Imenti MP bid.  Jessy dropped out of the race in favour of Mwiti Kathaara, who will now fly the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket in the August 9 General Election.  Kathaara attempted to clinch the Jubilee Party ticket in the 2017 polls, but lost to Shadrack Mwiti in the party primaries.  Shadrack Mwiti would lose the election to the incumbent Kathuri Murungi, who ran on independent ticket.  Murungi defended the seat after winning first term in 2013 under the now-defunct The National Alliance (TNA) Party. Kathaara is now seeking to unseat him.  Announcing MC Jessy’s exit from the South Imenti contest, Deputy President William Ruto said on Wednesday, April 13 that the comedian would take up duties within his presidential campaign secretariat.  "MC Jessy will join the presidential campaign team after postponing his parliamentary bid in favour of Mwiti Kathaara for the South Imenti Seat,” said Ruto.  This marks yet another nomination deal that Ruto and team are striking through negotiated democracy.  The DP has brokered deals among key aspirants in Nairobi and Kakamega for the positions of Governor and Senator.  In Nairobi, Johnson Sakaja will run for Governor while Margaret Wanjiru will eye the senatorial seat under UDA. This is despite their earlier acrimony over who between them was more suitable to run for city governor.  In Kakamega, Cleophas Malala won the fight for governor seat against his then-fiercest rival Boni Khalwale, who will now seek to replace Malala at the Senate.  Khalwale served as Kakamega’s first Senator when he won the seat in the March 4, 2013 General Election on Ford-Kenya ticket.
