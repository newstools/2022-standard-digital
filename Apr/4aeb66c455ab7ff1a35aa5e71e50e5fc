Emmanuel Kipkemboi went missing on March 29, and was found dead on March 31, 2022. [Peterson Githaiga, Standard]  An 11-year-old boy from Kisaju in Kajiado County, who went missing on Tuesday, March 29, has been found dead.  The body of Emmanuel Kipkemboi, a Grade 5 pupil, was on Thursday, March 31, found dumped in a newly-constructed house located a few metres from his parents’ home.  George Kipsang, a spokesperson of the deceased’s family, said the boy had seven stab wounds in different parts of his body.  “We suspect the abductors used a sharp knife to kill the boy,” he said. Kipkemboi’s body was taken to Athi River Shalom Community Hospital morgue.  The child’s mother, Mercy Kipsang, was too distraught to speak.  The deceased’s elder sister, Daisy Kibet, described Kipkemboi as a brilliant child.  “My brother was innocent and helpless. He did not deserve to die like that,” she said.  Isinya police boss Anthony Kaloki told The Standard that they’ve launched investigations into the boy’s death.  Kipkemboi was a pupil at the Sathya Sai School, Kisaju.
