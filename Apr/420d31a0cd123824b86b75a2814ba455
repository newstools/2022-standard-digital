Locusts invade Lungusaki area, Samburu East last year [Bruno Mutunga, Standard]  Farmers affected by the locust invasion two years ago have received Sh34 million in compensation.  The 139 groups from Samburu County received compensation under the World Bank-funded Emergency Locust Response Programme.  Samburu Deputy Governor Julius Leseeto, who handed over the cheque in Maralal Town yesterday, said the money will go a long way in help the farmers.  Desert locusts destroyed pasture and reversed gains that had been achieved through investment in crop production in the region, he said. The beneficiaries have been trained on funds use.  One of the beneficiaries, Joseph Lentaano, said the money was a big relief coming after the Covid-19 and drought.
