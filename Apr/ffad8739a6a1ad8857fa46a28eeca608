Seven people have been arrested in connection with the death of Joel Juma, a fourth-year student at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).  The 23-year-old Bachelor of Science (Industrial Chemistry) student was stabbed twice in the chest during a night attack at Juja, Kiambu County, on Tuesday.  The attackers also escaped with Juma’s mobile phone and other valuables.  Juma’s female friend, a law student at the Mt Kenya University, Parklands Campus, told police she had escorted her boyfriend to collect revision materials from his classmates a few blocks away, when the gang accosted them.   She said two of them descended on Juma with blows and kicks before stabbing him twice on the left side of his chest, leaving him lying on the ground.  Night guards who heard the commotion rushed to the scene and took Juma to a local dispensary where he was pronounced dead on arrival.  Juja Directorate of Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO) Richard Mwaura said out of the seven suspects, two are key and are likely to be charged with murder.  The murder has elicited fury and among students who now want police to investigate and arrest the killers.  Led by Lyra Wanjiku, a statistics and commerce student, the students protested rising insecurity in Juja that has been hampering their learning activities.  Student president Mark Thiong’o said many students have suffered injuries and lost valuable items in the hands of the notorious gang.  He said although they have been holding meetings with the Juja security team, criminal incidents have escalated due to reduced police patrols.   Police are now pursuing the gang, which they said has regrouped in Gachororo.   By Dominic Omondi | 1 day ago By Collins Kweyu | 1 day ago By Collins Kweyu | 1 day ago By Kamore Maina | 2 days ago
