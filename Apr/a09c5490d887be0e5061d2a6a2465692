Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) administration block. [File, Standard]  Police in Juja, Kiambu County have launched investigations into the death of a fourth year student at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) on Monday night.  Preliminary Investigations have revealed that Joel Juma was stabbed while in the company of her girlfriend at 2 am. The two were headed to one of his classmate’s residence to pick a revision material.  A tweet by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) indicated that the 23-year-old had been revising for his examinations.  “… Juma later woke up and embarked on his books but at 2am, he asked her to escort him to where a classmate lived a few blocks away, to get some reference material that he needed before morning,” DCI tweet read in part. Detectives say the two were attacked near hotel Lilies by three thugs who demanded for money and mobile phones.  “Two of them descended on Juma with blows and kicks before stabbing him twice on the left side of his chest, leaving him lying on the ground in a pool of blood. The third assailant manhandled the lady who hadn’t carried any valuable and luckily, left her unscathed,” the detectives said.  The attention of local guards were drawn to the commotion. They moved in and helped Juma’s girlfriend take him to a local dispensary where he was pronounced dead on arrival.  The investigators suspect the perpetrators were members of a notorious gang, which escaped the ongoing operation to rid Kayole and Dandora of criminals and who have found a safe haven in Gachororo.  Juma’s body has been moved to the morgue awaiting autopsy.     By Lynn Kolongei | 1 hour ago By Wainaina Wambu | 1 hour ago By Phares Mutembei | 1 hour ago By Kamore Maina | 1 hour ago
