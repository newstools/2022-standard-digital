Born seventy years ago, former lveti South MP the late Jonesmus Kikuyu will be remembered for his outstanding representation. Kikuyu, who died on Sunday at a private hospital in Machakos town after a long illness, has left a widow and eight children.  He was enrolled in Kitulu Primary School in 1961 and later joined Kangundo and Chongoria high schools respectively before proceeding to Kenyatta University. His political career started while in the university where he agitated for students’ rights. Before joining politics, Mr Kikuyu worked with Kenya Breweries Ltd. He later became a secondary school teacher, rising to the position of principal.  Political drama  His political career was not without drama. The MP was known for fighting for the rights of his constituents and the rest of Kenyans. When he won the Iveti South seat in 1979 he spearheaded the change of the name of the constituency to the current Machakos Town constituency.  He said the name Iveti South was demeaning women. To him, it meant ‘women south’, which he interpreted as an insult. According to those who worked with him, Mr Kikuyu worked for the interest of his constituents.  He left the political scene in 2002 after being ousted by Daudi Mwanzia. He once ruffled feathers when he said he will be appointed to the Cabinet once Mwai Kibaki becomes President. The declaration upset the government, leading to his arrest. Mr Kikuyu was set free after six months in jail.  His lawyer Jacob Mutula described the fallen politician as a courageous man.  A student of Kamba kingpin the late Paul Ngei, Mr Mutula said Mr Kikuyu would not tolerate anyone trying to topple residents’ rights.  “Such selfless politicians are rare.”   President Uhuru Kenyatta described him as a political maverick who contributed immensely to democracy.   By Stephanie Wangari | 3 hours ago By Fred Kagonye | 4 hours ago By Willis Oketch | 4 hours ago By Dennis Tarus | 6 hours ago
