Thomas Okari, a Nairobi-based businessman, who travelled to Kisii ahead of ODM primaries in the county on Thursday, April 7, has been hacked to death.  Okari, 38, left Nairobi for Kisii on Friday, April 1.  He was cut in the head using a panga by unknown people on Sunday night, April 3.  His nephew, Daniel Mayaka, who he lives with at his Bombamba home in Bomachoge Borabu, told The Standard that Okari arrived home at around 11pm, and went straight to his bedroom.  A gang of attackers gained forceful entry into his house through the backdoor and hacked him in the head using a panga. “After attacking my uncle, the assailants escaped through the backdoor,” Mayaka said.  Okari’s distress calls attracted the attention of Mayaka, who rushed to the businessman’s room.  Mayaka found Okari lying in a pool of blood. The nephew, thereafter, called for help and took his uncle to Oasis Specialist Hospital in Kisii, where Okari was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).  He, however, succumbed to his injuries at 7am on Monday, April 4.  It remains unclear what the motive of Okari’s fatal attack was, though his family suspects his participation in politics could have played a role.  Police say they have launched investigations into the businessman’s death.
