Another Kenyan has died under questionable circumstances in Saudi Arabia. Rael Aketch’s death has also led to the death of her mother, who collapsed after receiving the news of her daughter’s demise.  Gulf countries have become a death trap for poor Kenyans looking for greener pastures abroad. Notably, most of these deaths have been reported in Saudi Arabia.  Last year, the government revealed that 97 Kenyans had died in one of the Gulf countries in a span of two years, allegedly after being raped and tortured.  Despite talks between Kenya and Saudi Arabia aimed at ensuring dignified treatment for Kenyan workers, the situation keeps getting worse.  If the government cannot assure Kenyans of their safety, it should now stop sending workers to Saudi Arabia. We have lost far too many lives under dubious circumstances. We can’t afford to lose more.
