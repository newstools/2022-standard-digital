A family of six has perished in an overnight house fire in Makeji village in Kandara, Murang'a County.  A 58-year-old widow, Mary Wangui,  died in the fire on Saturday, April 9 night together with her kin.  Others who perished in the inferno are Cecilia Gathoni, Lucy Mumbi ( who just completed KCSE exams at Guthoro Secondary School), Jackline Wambui (a 10-year-old), Alvin Kiarie (a three-year-old) and Margaret Wanja (a Form Two student.)  Neighbours and sources who witnessed the incident didn't rule out arson.  Police reports indicate that the main suspect is a relative, who was in an argument with the family before the tragedy. “The family has been having land dispute issues for some time now,” Henry Muindi, a relative told The Standard.  However, police are yet to give an official communication concerning the incident.  The bodies have been moved to General Kago Funeral Home, Thika.  The main suspect is in custody at Kabati Police Station as homicide detectives investigate.     By Ibrahim Karanja | 4 hours ago By Biketi Kikechi | 14 hours ago By Ben Ahenda | 15 hours ago By Wainaina Ndung’u | 15 hours ago
