ODM leader Raila Odinga. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Azimio la Umoja presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga has appointed three strategists to spearhead his diaspora campaigns in the United Kingdom and Europe.  In a letter dated March 30, Odinga appointed Mr Ali Ali, Mr Maina Gatangi, the current Chairman of Azimio la Umoja Diaspora UK, and Ms Rose Seko the Secretary-General, to coordinate his agenda for the diaspora community.  The coordinators, said Odinga, shall work in liaison with various sectors of diaspora society, coordinate and consolidate various Azimio la Umoja coalition partners to implement a tangible and achievable campaign strategy.  The team will also work in close cooperation with the national presidential campaign secretariat in Kenya and will be expected to fundraise for its own activities. Ali Ali.

According to Gatangi, the team shall also focus on mobilization in Kenya through initiatives funded by the diaspora.  "With low voter registration in the diaspora, we shall focus more on campaign mobilization back home," said Gatangi.  The diaspora secretariat recently organized Odinga's tour of Central London where over 600 Azimio supporters turned up for a meeting at Kensington during his high-level visit to the UK.  During the event, the diaspora signed the ‘Azimio Declaration’ and vowed to support Raila Odinga's presidency.
