Police have arrested a 38-year-old man suspected of conspiring with others to defraud three people out of Sh1.8 million.  The suspect had allegedly obtained Sh600,000 from each of his three victims under the pretense that he’d secure them admission to the Kenya Police Training College in Kiganjo, Nyeri County.  All the three victims, two men and a woman aged 25, 28 and 20 respectively, hail from Nandi County.  A report filed at the Karatina Police Station in Mathira East, Nyeri County says the victims recorded statements after learning that they’d been conned.  On Wednesday, April 6, the three were dropped outside a hotel near Kencom House in Nairobi by their parents so that they could be “taken to the Kiganjo Police College” by the person who “helped them secure admission”. “They were issued with documents purported to be police docket numbers after each paying Sh600,000. In total, they parted with Sh1.8 million,” says the police report filed at Karatina under the OB Number 37/06/05/2022.  The victims, thereafter, entered the suspect’s car so that they could be taken to Kiganjo.  “The suspect transported the three in a black Toyota Noah of registration plate KDA 9*6Y. Upon reaching Karatina Town, the suspect told the victims to alight so that they could all have their lunch,” said the police report.  After lunch, the suspect told the three “Kiganjo-bound recruits” that the Toyota Noah had been stolen from the parking lot.  “The suspect failed to convince the complainants. He, thereafter, attempted to escape. However, he was caught by one of the complainants,” said the police report.  The suspect was handed over to Karatina Police Station as investigations continue.  Besides the money, the victims lost their KCSE certificates, three original ID cards and their personal belonging.
