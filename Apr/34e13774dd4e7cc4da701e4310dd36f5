Migori Senator Ochilo Ayacko is to be given direct ODM nomination to vie for the governorship, party chairman John Mbadi has said.  Mbadi said an opinion poll done in the county showed Ayacko, a key ally of ODM leader Raila Odinga, was the most favourite to succeed governor Okoth Obado who is serving his second and final term. Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo and businessman Philip Mwabe were also seeking to fly the ODM flag in the governorship race.  “Migori governor ODM ticket is going to Ochillo Ayacko. We have Pamela who was strong and we are negotiating where we can place her,” Mbadi said.  According to the legislator, the winner of the Senate seat is known, implying that the most competitive aspirant for the seat Eddy Oketch could get the ODM ticket. In Migori, Mbadi said ODM primaries will be done in Suna West for MP seat and Woman Representative where universal suffrage will be used. Speaking at Ramogi FM, the legislator noted that the process would also cover all the 40 wards seats in the county.  “The information I have now is that Woman Representative aspirants will go universal suffrage way and the same will happen in Suna West because the difference is only 7 per cent (between Peter Masara and Joseph Ndiege),” Mr. Mbadi said. Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and his counterpart Rongo MP Paul Abuor will be issued direct certificates as they had no competitors.
