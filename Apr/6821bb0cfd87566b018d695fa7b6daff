President Uhuru Kenyatta has mourned former Machakos Town MP Jonesmus Mwanza Kikuyu, who died on Sunday evening, as a political maverick who contributed immensely to the growth of Kenya’s democracy.  Kikuyu died at the age of 70 years while receiving treatment at a Machakos hospital.  He was a seasoned parliamentarian who served as Iveti South legislator in the late 1970s to early 1980s, and as Machakos Town MP between 1997 and 2002.  In his message of comfort and encouragement, Uhuru eulogised Kikuyu as one of Kenya's foremost pro-democracy politicians who, together with others, championed for the freedoms of thought, expression, and association among other pillars of a democratic society.  “We will forever cherish the contribution of Hon Jonesmus Kikuyu and his generation of political leaders for the firm foundation of our nation's democratic ideals. As a pro-democracy activist, Hon Kikuyu was a steadfast, firm, and principled visionary and luminary who fought hard for the good of our society,” the president mourned.  He said the late Kikuyu's deep commitment and devotion to the improvement of the welfare of wananchi endeared him to the people of Machakos who elected him for a record three terms as their representative in parliament.  “We are indeed indebted to him for the work he did for all Kenyans. A development conscious leader, Hon Kikuyu leaves behind a rich portfolio of development projects he initiated during his tenure," the President noted, adding that the former MP was a firm believer in women empowerment who mobilised women to form self-help groups and join Maendeleo ya Wanawake organization.  The Head of State prayed for comfort to the family of Kikuyu.  By James Omoro | 7 hours ago By Kennedy K Gachuhi | 8 hours ago By Muriithi Mugo | 13 hours ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 13 hours ago
