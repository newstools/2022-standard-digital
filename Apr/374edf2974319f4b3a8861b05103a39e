Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar will run for the area governor seat on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket.  Khamisi Mwaguya will seek the senatorial seat on the same party’s ticket, Deputy President William Ruto announced on Wednesday, April 13.  Ruto further revealed, in a press statement, that Fatma Bakari will fly the party’s ticket for the Mombasa Woman Representative seat.  The deputy president said the trio had reached a consensus as UDA prepares to hold its nationwide nominations on Thursday, April 14.  “We are glad the Mombasa UDA team has reached a consensus on Hassan Omar Hassan as its gubernatorial candidate, Khamisi Mwaguya as the Senate contender and Fatma Bakari Barayan as the Women Rep contestant,” said Ruto. Nyali MP Mohamed Ali, who clinched the seat on an independent ticket in the August 8, 2017 polls, will seek to defend the position on a UDA ticket.  Others who have been given direct UDA nomination are Mbarak Hamid (Kisauni), Karisa Nzai Mnyika (Jomvu), Isaac Malilah (Changamwe), Omar Shallo (Mvita) and Mohamed Mwahima (Likoni).  The DP had, a few hours before the fresh announcements, revealed that comedian MC Jessy, whose real name is Jasper Muthomi, had dropped out of the South Imenti MP race.  Jessy, who joins Ruto’s presidential campaign secretariat, would now support Mwiti Kathaara for the South Imenti seat.  Kathaara unsuccessfully sought a Jubilee Party ticket for the same seat in the last general election. He lost to Shadrack Mwiti, who was floored by Kathuri Murungi, an independent candidate.  Kathuri is currently serving his second term as South Imenti MP.  By Stephanie Wangari | 27 minutes ago By Standard Team | 5 hours ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 5 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 6 hours ago
