President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged lawmakers from the Great Lakes region to come up with legislation on conflicts resolution.  Uhuru reminded the legislators that they have a role to play in ensuring the region remains economically stable and secure.  He said although relations among member States have been lukewarm, tensions have eased due to collaboration.  "The region has improved from the recurring conflicts and tensions that once caused easily avoidable deaths and displacement of many people and destruction of property within and across borders," said President Kenyatta when he opened a two-day conference for MPs from Angola, Burundi, Central African, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.   "As we emerge from that hot past, we must not lose sight of the fact that conflict is a menace that robs our people of immense dividends and opportunities inherent in peace and stability. Conflict increases unemployment, especially of young people; fuels sexual violence against women and girls.”  The President called on the parliamentarians to inculcate public participation in conflict prevention and resolution.  Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka urged the parliamentarians to capitalise on the intra-Africa and cross-border ties and trade relations.  Lusaka, who is the assembly president, said the forum remains a pillar in spearheading discourse on security and development.
