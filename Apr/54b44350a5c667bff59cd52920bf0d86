Police in Isinya, Kajiado County, are holding a 14-year-old boy in connection with the murder of a Grade Five pupil.  Emmanuel Kipkemboi, 11, was killed last week and his body dumped in an incomplete building in Kisaju.  ''It's true we are holding the minor whom we can't disclose the name at this time. We have evidence linking him to this particular murder. However, we are still interrogating him so that we can get full information on what transpired," said Isinya police boss Ancient Kaloki.  Police said they are treating the boy as the one responsible for the death.  "Since the boy is more than 12 years old, he is criminally responsible. We are not classifying the boy as a minor. He planned and executed this,'' said Mr Kaloki. The detectives are yet to establish if the suspect committed the crime alone.  Kipkemboi, a pupil at the Sathya Sai School, was found dead after he went missing.  The family said his body had more than 17 deep wounds suspected to have been inflicted by a knife.  "We suspect the killers used a very sharp knife to kill our boy since he has been stabbed several times," said a relative George Kibet.  The boy's sister Daisy Kibet said her brother loved football and was dedicated at school.  "It's very sad that someone decided to take the life of my innocent brother. My appeal to the police is that they bring to book those who committed this inhuman act. My brother didn't deserve to die," she said.
