Bags of maize at the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) warehouse in Nakuru. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Hundreds of farmers are thronging National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depots to buy subsided fertiliser.  Dozens of trucks, tractors and pickups have been lining up outside depots countrywide to purchase the scarce input ahead of the planting season.  In Nyanza, fertiliser is available in Kisumu and Muhoroni depots while in Western it is offered in Kakamega depot. The Yala depot, which is at the border of Nyanza and Western, also has some stocks.  Yesterday, NCPB officials said a 50kg of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) is selling at Sh2,800, adding that they were getting supplies from local manufacturers then selling to growers. NCPB Corporate Affairs Manager Titus Maiyo confirmed that fertiliser is available. However, due to high demand, the agency is only issuing five bags per farmer.  There is a rush by farmers from Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya, Nyamira, Kisii and Kisumu to buy the commodity before stocks run out.  “We are issuing few bags to ensure many farmers benefit. More bags will be provided,” Maiyo said.    By Daniel Chege | 2 hours ago By Ibrahim Karanja | 4 hours ago By Mactilda Mbenywe | 5 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 6 hours ago
