Raila Odinga’s chopper that was damaged in Soy, Uasin Gishu County on April 1, 2022. [Standard]  Fourteen (14) people have been arrested in connection with the stoning of ODM leader Raila Odinga’s helicopter in Soy Constituency, Uasin Gishu County on Friday evening.  Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Stephen Kihara has told The Standard that the 14 will be arraigned on Monday, April 4 once investigations are concluded.  Kihara said seven police officers had been deployed to provide security, when Raila Odinga arrived at Kabenes in Soy for the burial of prominent Uasin Gishu farmer Jackson Kibor.  A crowd of rowdy youth pelted his entourage with stones, damaging Raila Odinga’s helicopter air-shield in the melee. No casualties were reported.  Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i on Friday night ordered that the perpetrators of the violence in Soy should be arrested and prosecuted.
