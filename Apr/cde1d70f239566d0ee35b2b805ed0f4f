Services at the Machakos Level Five Hospital came to a halt on Friday after medical personnel went on strike.  Patients who had come to seek services were left stranded as medical personnel, who comprised doctors, clinical officers and nurses, went on a go-slow to compel the county government to provide drugs in the hospital.  "Our plea to the county government is to make sure drugs and other medical facilities are provided to rid patients of suffering," one medic said.  The health workers were forced to go into the streets to fight for the welfare of poor patients.   "We pity poor patients who come to the hospital but cannot afford medicine sold in commercial chemists," said one of the doctors.  Ruth Mutie, the acting Machakos County Health Executive in Charge (CEC) did not respond to our calls and messages to her phone went unanswered.    By Collins Kweyu | 16 days ago By Philip Muasya | 17 days ago By Victor Nzuma | 23 days ago By Anne Atieno | 24 days ago
