Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi has maintained that he is still in the race to win Nairobi County governorship.  However, he will await the decision of the Azimio One Kenya coalition party leadership, whose his party Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) is part of.  "Ladies and gentlemen, leadership is a calling. Throughout my political career, the people I serve have been the backbone of my leadership. It has never been about me, I listen to the people," said Wanyonyi.  He added: "The coalition which I belong to that is Azimio One Kenya coalition party is in consultation and will be issuing a statement very soon about Nairobi. From the beginning, I always say it’s not about me but us. I am still in the race. The decision of the coalition will also either add weight on it or subtract. We will wait for that communication which will be soon."  The remarks come following rumours that he might have been prevailed upon at State House to step down for Jubilee party candidate Richard Ngatia. Whoever Azimio One Kenya Coalition party will settle on, will battle it out with Kenya Kwanza coalition’s candidate and current Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja among other candidates.
