Polling officers leave with polling materials from Jeremiah Nyaga Technical Training Institute at 4:30 pm on Wednesday, April 14, 2022 [Muriithi Mugo, Standard]  It was a chaotic start to the UDA nominations, marred by low voter turn out.  At Jeremiah Nyaga Technical Training Centre, which is the tallying centre for Mbeere South constituency, polling materials left as late as 5.00pm.  Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen who was overseeing the nominations in the county assured residents that the polls would go on as planned despite the destruction of election materials on Wednesday.  He said the chaos and destruction of election materials was under probe by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. “Our party does not condone violence and those found culpable will also be disqualified,” said Mr Murkomen.   He attributed the delay to the start of the voting to logistical challenges given that they were working with a lean budget of Sh300 million.  At the same time, Embu County Commissioner Eddyson Nyale said police have launched a crackdown on perpetrators of election violence ahead of the August 9 General Election.  This comes a day after rowdy youths intercepted a truck ferrying UDA nominations and set the election materials ablaze outside Izaak Walton Hotel along Embu-Meru highway.  “Embu has been and is a peaceful county that embraces diversity of political views and we shall not allow anybody to interfere with the prevailing calm,” Mr Nyale said.
