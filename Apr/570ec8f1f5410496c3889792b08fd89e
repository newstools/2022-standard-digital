Embakasi East MP Babu Owino in Parliament on April 14, 2022. [Screengrab]  Embakasi East Member of Parliament (MP) Babu Owino caused a storm in the National Assembly on Thursday, April 14 after he refused to leave the Chamber following his kick-out out over unacceptable behaviour.  Owino allegedly made remarks that Speaker Justin Muturi said amounted to disorderly behaviour in the House.  At the time, Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi was tabling evidence suggesting Deputy President William Ruto has been involved in land malpractice in the country.  On Tuesday, April 12 Gedi alleged that she had concrete details proving Ruto grabbed land in Trans Nzoia, Lang’ata, Nairobi and Laikipia. Gedi arrived in Parliament on Thursday with a suitcase, saying it had all the evidence needed to prove her claims.  Speaker Muturi, however, said Gedi did not table all the evidence at once as required.  The Woman Representative wanted to produce proof on each land per speaking session.  That, the Speaker said, would consume time and was unprocedural.  It was during the chaos that Babu Owino stood to support Gedi, resulting in the melee that paralysed House business.  The Embakasi East MP said something that appeared to anger the Speaker, who ordered him out immediately.  MPs affiliated to Azimio la Umoja, however, threw a cordon around Babu Owino, preventing the Serjeant-at-Arms from kicking him out.  The impasse forced the Speaker to adjourn the House to Tuesday, May 10, saying his orders had been disobeyed.  Muturi will announce further disciplinary action against Babu Owino during the next session.
