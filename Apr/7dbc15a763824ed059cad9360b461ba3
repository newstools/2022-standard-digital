Police are investigating the death of a teenager at a popular paraglider on Monday.  The 19-year-old had gone for fun during the Easter break at the Kerio escarpment when she died.  Police say the teenager hit a rock after the paraglider detached as she was riding at the popular spot at Kessup near Iten town, Elgeyo Marakwet.  “She had several bruises and a broken leg. Our officers and locals pulled her out of the paraglider but died when she was about to be driven from the scene to a nearby hospital,” said Keiyo North Police Commander Tom Makori.  Area Assistant Chief Cedric Changwony said the teenager sat the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination this month. The body was taken to the Iten County Referral Hospital.  Paragliding activities have been on the decline in the area after a number of accidents.  In January 2018, two Germans who were paragliding were killed at Emis, Nyaru Location.  In the same year, 39-year-old American Kimbery Ann died alongside a Czech, Tomas Lednik, in another accident.  Ann had been living in Kenya since 2001 and was a frequent visitor to Iten where paragliding has been common for a long time.
