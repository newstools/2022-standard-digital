The Murang'a County government has embarked on massive vaccination of cows following outbreak of lumpy skin disease. Three cows succumbed to the disease in Kiria in Mugoiri location, prompting authorities to order farmers in the upper region of the county to present their animals for vaccination.  Teams have vaccinated animals in Kiharu and Gatanga to check against the possible spread of the disease.  Kiharu Veterinary Officer Mr George Wamenjo said the disease was first reported in Kiria village, Mugoiri location, Kahuro sub-County, where 15 cows contracted the disease.  He said 1,000 livestock have been vaccinated, with farmers paying Sh100 per animal.
