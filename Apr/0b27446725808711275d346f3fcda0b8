Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said he is taking a backseat in Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya politics.  Kibwana says he has made the decision because he has been sidelined in Azimio la Umoja after Kalonzo Musyoka joined the coalition matrix.  Without mentioning names, Kibwana told The Standard that powerful people within Azimio were forcing the outfit to take the shape of a three-legged stool that has Jubilee, ODM and Wiper as the anchor political parties.  The governor took to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, April 20, to inform Kenyans that he has been forced to take a lower profile within the Azimio la Umoja structure.  “It is proving impossible to work with @skmusyoka in Azimio in Ukambani. After he joined us, he has wanted especially me out of all Azimio structures. I have no choice but to be at peace with this sad reality. History will ultimately judge all of us. May it be kind [to] @RailaOdinga,” he said. Focus on Makueni politics  When The Standard reached out to Kibwana, he said he will now concentrate his efforts on his Makueni Senate bid and will scale down his activities at the national level.  That means, Kibwana won’t be seen regularly campaigning for Raila Odinga’s presidential bid outside Makueni or the neighbouring Ukambani counties.  “When you are pushed to the corner, and there is no space to wiggle or even make a contribution, you are left with no option but to step back,” said Kibwana.  He, however, maintains that he is still a member of the Azimio la Umoja team.  His remarks come on the back of a push by Kalonzo Musyoka and his team to have the Wiper chief named as Raila Odinga’s running mate.
