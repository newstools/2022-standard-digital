A fierce fire has razed Ruma National Park in the past two days, endangering wildlife.  The inferno broke out on Sunday at Kor Lang’o in Kwabwai ward, Ndhiwa sub-county at about 11 pm.  It later spread to Rachar and Sigama in Ndhiwa and Olando in Suba sub-county.  The inferno put the lives of reptiles, amphibians and small animals at risk.  Some animals such as ant-bear, deer and hare are suspected to have been injured or scared by the fire.  Wild birds which lay eggs on the ground are also at risk.  During dry seasons, many farmers around the park clear their farms using fire and it is suspected that the inferno might have emanated from one of the farms.  Ruma is the only National Game Park in Kenya with a rare species of antelopes known as roan antelopes.  However, the roan antelopes had not been interfered with since the affected areas are kilometres away from their habitat.  Homa Bay County Commissioner Moses Lilan said adequate measures had been put in place to end the fire.  Lilan said the fire was being contained and there was no cause for alarm.  “Our wild animals are out of danger for now because we have put the fire under control. The fire which is remaining is sporadic and it is manageable,” Lilan said.  The administrator told residents to avoid lighting fires near the park.  “I am urging our farmers and anybody living around to avoid lighting fire near the park. The prevailing dry weather is a recipe for fires to spread further,” Lilan said.  The administrator said his office is sensitising residents on the protection of animals.  Ruma is considered an important resource for attracting tourists to Homa Bay County.  It is the only game park found in the Nyanza region comprising six counties.  Apart from the roan antelopes, the park has rhinos, zebras and other wild animals which attract tourists.
