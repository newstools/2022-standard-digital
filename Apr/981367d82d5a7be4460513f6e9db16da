Kenyans this morning turned out in large numbers to pay their last respects to Kenya's third President Mwai Kibaki.  Kibaki's body is lying in state for the second day at Parliament Buildings. Tomorrow will be the last day of public viewing.  The former head-of-state will be accorded a national state funeral with full military honours and protocols at Nyayo National Stadium on Friday   These include conveyance of the body in a Gun Carriage, accompanied by Military Musical Honours and a 19 gun-salute.  The retired President will be buried at his Othaya home on Saturday.  Just like on Monday, the former President's body was in the early morning carried in a gun carriage from Lee Funeral Home to Parliament for public viewing.     The former President’s casket was draped with the national flag as it snaked its way to Parliament.    Kenyans from all walks of life braved the chilly weather as they patiently queued to have a chance to pay their last respects to the former head of state.           By Judah Ben-Hur | 2 hours ago By George Maringa | 3 hours ago By Stephanie Wangari | 4 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 6 hours ago
