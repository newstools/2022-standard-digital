The Government has declared Tuesday, May 3 a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Fitr.  Interior Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i on Tuesday, April 26 gazetted Tuesday, May 3 as a holiday.  Idd-ul-Fitr signifies the end of the Holy Month of Ramadhan.  Muslims across the world celebrate Idd-ul-Fitr after observing the month-long fasting period called Ramadhan.  “It is notified for the general information of the public that the Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Co-ordination of National Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2 (1) of the Public Holidays Act, declares that Tuesday, the 3rd May, 2022, shall be a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Fitr,” he said in the Gazette Notice Number 4843. Due to the declaration of Tuesday, May 3 a public holiday, it presents another long weekend for Kenyans.  Friday, April 29 had been declared a national holiday in honour of President Mwai Kibaki. On that day, his state funeral service will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium.  Labour Day, which is celebrated on May 1, will fall on a Sunday, a non-working day. That means it would be pushed back to Monday, May 2.  Again, Tuesday will be a public holiday.  That means if a civil servant, who works from Monday to Friday, leaves work on Thursday, April 28, the next time he will be returning to work, will be Wednesday, May 4.
