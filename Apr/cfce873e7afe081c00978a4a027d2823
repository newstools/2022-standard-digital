Jubilee Party logo [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  Jubilee Party aspirants in Nyandarua County have faulted a move to persuade them to embrace consensus instead of universal suffrage in party primaries.  Led by Wahome Kamoche, an aspirant for the Rurii Ward, and Hellena Wambu, who is vying for the Kaimbaga MCA seat, the aspirants want the Jubilee Party leadership to allow them seek votes directly from residents.  They want the party to create a level playing ground for all aspirants to woo their supporters to back their bids in the primaries.  “We want the electorate to decide and not the party officials. Let them call for immediate party nominations before time elapses,” said Kamoche. He said it would be unfair to use consensus method as many contenders had spent their resources campaigning.    “We have spent our time and resources mobilising residents only to hear that we will not go to nominations. This is very unfair,” protested Wambui.  Kamoche said certain individuals were intimidating aspirants opposed to the consensus method.  Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni said the party wanted the consensus method in various counties rather than universal suffrage.  “We want all those aspiring candidates to build consensus. If they go different ways after the nominations, we are afraid that we might lose the seats,” he said.  JP is expected to hold its primaries next week.  It is still not clear whether the party will eventually opt for universal suffrage is being demanded by aspirants.
