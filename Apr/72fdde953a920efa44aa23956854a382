A family in Naivasha is demanding justice over the murder of their 24-year-old daughter.  The family termed the death of Sheila Adhiambo as painful, saying the police are yet to arrest any suspect one week after she was found lying in a pool of blood in her house in Karatina, Nyeri.  Last week, unknown persons raided the home of the victim, raped and murdered her for allegedly being a lesbian.  A visit by the family to Karatina did not yield any answers before they transferred the body to Naivasha sub-County hospital mortuary.  Amnesty International condemned the murder and vowed to stand with the family noting that no one deserved the treatment the deceased got. “We are standing in solidarity with the family of Sheila Adhiambo during the trying moments and we shall follow up this matter until justice is delivered,” they tweeted.  According to her father, John Lumumba, the police were taking them round in circles over the murder of his daughter who had been working in Karatina town.  Speaking at the family’s home in Naivasha, Lumumba told of their agony as they seek justice with several suspects arrested and later released.  “She died a very painful death as her house and personal effects were soaked in blood meaning she bled a lot,” he said.  He added that a post mortem indicated that the deceased was hit by a blunt object on the head. She also had stab wounds on her upper body.  “There are many rumours around her death including a fallout with workmates but all that we are calling for is justice,” he said.  Her mother, Millicent Oloo termed the murder as the most painful thing that had ever occurred for the family.  “My daughter died a very painful death as her house was covered in blood and we are calling on police to arrest those behind this heinous action,” she said.
