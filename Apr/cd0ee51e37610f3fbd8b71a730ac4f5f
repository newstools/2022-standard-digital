Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo [David Njaaga, Standard]  Some 40 families in Rarieda, Siaya County, that surrendered their land to create room for two colleges have received Sh2.2 million compensation.  The families gave out 16 acres, valued at Sh4.6 million, which will be home to Rarieda Teachers Training College and the National Youth Service training centre.  Area MP Otiende Amollo, who spoke in Bwaja in East Asembo Ward while issuing cheques to the landowners on Thursday, said the balance would be paid by October.  The MP said the government is still negotiating with four other families that have been reluctant to surrender their land. "Bwaja residents voluntarily gave their land for the projects. What they have received as compensation are mere tokens of appreciation since they expect the two institutions to bring a positive economic impact in the region," said Amollo.  Amollo said construction works for the TTC, which will be fully funded through the CDF kitty, will start in August, with the first phase set to cost Sh10 million.  The NYS training centre will be funded by the Interior ministry.   By Patrick Vidija | 12 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By Stanley Ongwae | 1 day ago
