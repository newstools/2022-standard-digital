A prisoner who impersonated Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa to defraud a woman Sh800,000 has been jailed for three years.  Patrick Shikure Amere was sentenced without the option of fine because he is already serving a life sentence.  Amere appeared before Milimani Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo and was jailed after he admitted swindling a job-seeker.  “The punishment makes no difference but I hand him three years to deter other offenders,” said Kagendo.
