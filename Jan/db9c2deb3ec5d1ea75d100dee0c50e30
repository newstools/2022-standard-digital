Many Kenyans are understandably apprehensive over the rising political temperature, stoked especially by politicians who seem to care less for this country.  It is for this reason that clergymen and women under the banner of Church and Clergy Association of Kenya have called for “the drums of war to be silenced now rather than later.”  We have seen what divisive elections can do many times. We should not walk down the dark tunnel as we near the August elections. Therefore, as politicians campaign around the country they must refrain from making utterances that have the potential to drive a wedge between Kenyans and cause bloodshed. IEBC and other relevant agencies must stay alert to shut up any hate-spewing political motormouths.     By Editorial | 4 hours ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 3 days ago By Nicholas Asego | 4 days ago Mistrust rocks 'third force' OKA as Ruto, Raila woo principals
