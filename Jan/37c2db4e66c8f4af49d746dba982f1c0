Police said the 24-kg ivory was valued at Sh9.1 million. [File, Standard]  Police in Busia have arrested two suspects on suspicion of trafficking 26 kilograms of ivory valued at Sh9.1 million.  The two, a Kenyan and a Ugandan, who were arrested at Korinda in Matayos Sub-County on Friday, January 28, are suspected to have sneaked in the ivory from Uganda.  Police said they acted on intelligence to nab the male suspects, who were allegedly transporting the tusks on a motorbike.  “They had stashed the tusks in a sack, and concealed them using cassava pieces. They were trying to pass a police roadblock on the Busia-Kisumu Road, where we cornered them,” said Busia County Deputy Police Commander Stephen Kimunya. The suspects are being held in custody at the Busia Police Station as investigations continue.
