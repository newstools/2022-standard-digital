Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir [Courtesy]  A member of the Legislative Council of Kenya (LegCo) Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir has died.  Nassir died on Tuesday morning at his house in Kizingo, Mombasa, according to his son Istanbul Abdilahi Nassir. He died at the age of 89.  "He died in his sleep and he will be buried at Maziara ya Kilindini later," said Abdilahi.  Nassir was elected to represent Mombasa constituency in 1961 at the Legco.  He fought for the independence of the protectorate of Kenya, a narrow strip along the Indian Ocean coast.  Coast politicians led by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho eulogised Nassir as a revered scholar who was at the forefront in fighting for independence.  "It is with profound sadness that I receive the news of the passing on of Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir. He was a highly revered scholar, a literary genius and a man of impeccable character," said Joho.  Deputy President William Ruto said Nassir served Legco between 1961 and 1963 well.  "Nassir was an academic giant, an astute political thinker and a faithful force for development who made a huge contribution to the aspirations of Coast region," said Ruto.  Banker Suleiman Shahbal said Nassir was an eminent elder in Mombasa.   By Philip Mwakio | 1 hour ago By Nehemiah Okwembah | 1 hour ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 15 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago
