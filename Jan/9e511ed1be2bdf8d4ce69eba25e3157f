Police probe car ferrying bhang that rolled along the Thogoto - Mutarakwa Road yesterday spilling the illegal cargo along. [Gerorge Njunge, Standard]  A car ferrying bhang rolled along the Thogoto - Mutarakwa road yesterday spilling the illegal cargo along the busy bypass.  The car rolled at a sharp bend approximately three kilometers off Kamandura-Maai Mahiu road. According to eyewitnesses, the driver of the car was speeding when he encountered a very sharp bend and lost control that saw the vehicle roll.  Muthioma Nyaga who was at the scene said the car was speeding before it veered off the bend. He added that the driver managed to take off from the scene using a boda boda. He is reported to have told the boda boda operator that he needed to get a break-down to tow his vehicle to a police station.  Police from nearby Ndeiya Police Station visited the scene and were shocked when they opened the car boot, only to discover stashed sacks of bhang. They later called in a break-down to tow the car to Tigoni Police Station. Efforts by police to trace the boda boda bore no fruits. Confirming the incidence Limuru sub-county OCPD Eileen Mola said investigations are ongoing.
