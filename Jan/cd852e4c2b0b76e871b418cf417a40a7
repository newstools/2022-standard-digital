Businessman Suleiman Shahbal. [Courtesy]  Mombasa businessman and politician Suleiman Shahbal has secured training opportunities for 10 medical doctors in Istanbul, Turkey.  Shahbal, who is running for governor, said that Istanbul Medeniyat University has offered free training on specialised oncology (cancer) at the institution’s hospital.  He secured the offer on Sunday after meeting Prof Sadrettin Pence who is the University’s vice-rector. Pence, he said, has set up affordable hospitals in Sudan, Somalia, and a few others in other African countries.  “Prof Pence has offered to train 10 doctors on specialised oncology for free through his university hospital which is the largest in Turkey….. I will take this offer to the county government of Mombasa,” he noted in a Facebook post, adding, “There is so much that can be done with Turkey to assist us in Mombasa.” The two met in Turkey where Shahbal had been invited by the city of Istanbul for meetings with potential investors.  The businessman seeks to succeed Mombasa governor Hassan Joho in the August polls. In ODM, Shahbal faces competition for the party ticket from Mvita MP Mr Abdulswamad Nassir and deputy governor, Dr William Kingi.  Also in the heated race are Kisauni MP Mr Ali Mbogo of Wiper Democratic Movement, former Mombasa senator Mr Hassan Omar (United Democratic Alliance) and former Nyali MP Mr Awiti Bollo of Vibrant Democratic Party.   By Philip Mwakio | 8 hours ago By Daisy Omondi | 13 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 23 hours ago By Philip Mwakio | 23 hours ago
