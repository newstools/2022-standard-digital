A woman has died by suicide after she reportedly killed her two children following a dispute with her husband in Gatanga constituency, Murang'a County, on Sunday.  Mary Malombe, a resident of Kakuzi village in Ithanga, accused her husband, a Kenya Defence Force officer based at the Coast, of cheating on her.   Ithanga sub-county police commander John Ogolla said a suicide note they found at the scene indicated that the 29-year-old committed suicide after poisoning her two children. She was angered by her husband's alleged involvement in extramarital affairs.  "We suspect she poisoned the children only identified as Mbinya and Mawa and aged five and two respectively on Saturday night. She also left behind her ATM cards and a note bearing the PIN numbers," said Ogalla.   The bodies have been moved to General Kago Mortuary at the Thika Level Five Hospital awaiting postmortem.  A neighbour, Ms Mary Mueni, urged the government to invest in mental health saying some of the murders and suicides being reported in the country are a result of mental problems.  "She looked disturbed and frequently quarrelled with her husband but nobody thought it would end so tragically," Mueni said.  The incident came only one week after one Nancy Munjiru, of Kianderi village in Kahuro sub-county, reportedly stabbed her two children with a knife, killing one on the spot. The other one is admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital.   By Muriithi Mugo | 3 days ago By Betty Njeru | 4 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 4 days ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 5 days ago Raila's big show in Thika stirs up Mt Kenya region
