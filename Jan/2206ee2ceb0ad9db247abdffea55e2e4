Sales representatives at the Dragon Motors dealer’s offices in Naivasha. [Standard]  Motor vehicle and motorcycle dealers in Kenya have until April 1, 2022, to register for new digital licences with the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA).  Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, in a statement Friday, said the move is aimed at “tightening regulations and curbing proceeds of crime laundered through such businesses to fund terrorism and other criminal activities.”  Dealers who qualify for the licences will be issued with digital cards, while older licenses will expire on April 1.  NTSA on Friday launched new number plates for garage operators as KG, tow trucks as KT, and container freight stations as KC. The authority said the new plates will replace the red KG plates as of February 1, 2022.  “Motor vehicle dealers have until April 30 to present credentials for fresh digital registration,” CS Matiang’i noted.  “All existing red KG plates must be surrendered to NTSA and replaced with digital green plates by April 1. Existing plates will be rendered obsolete by said date.”  Further, the Interior CS directed as X-number plates nullified immediately.  Matiang’I said this followed recommendations by a multi-agency team to revalidate all motor vehicle, motorcycle dealers, manufacturers, repairers of motor vehicles, and low truck owners.
