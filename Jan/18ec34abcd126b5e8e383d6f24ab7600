Former Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  Former Mukurweini Member of Parliament Kabando wa Kabando has expressed interest in Nyeri Senator's seat now held by Ephraim Maina.   Kabando communicated via his social media platforms on Thursday that he will be seeking the seat in the August 9 General Election, following wide consultations on the ground.  “Upon wide consultations, urgings, online and grassroots surveys, and my spirit to so serve, I offer myself to be Senator of the Nyeri County,” he tweeted.  It was, however, not clear what Party he will be vying under, but indicated that he would relay more information in the coming weeks. “I pledge clean decent issues campaign,” he said.  Although now he is into public policy consultancy, Kabando is not new in the political arena.  He served as Mukurweini MP for two terms from 2007-2017.  In 2017, he unsuccessfully contested for the same seat under an independent ticket.  He told The Standard in 2019 that he had retreated to focus on his private projects. “I am also recouping, reviving, and completing my private projects that political life denied me time to finalise,” he said.      By Muriithi Mugo | 5 hours ago By Phares Mutembei | 22 hours ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 1 day ago By George Njunge | 2 days ago
