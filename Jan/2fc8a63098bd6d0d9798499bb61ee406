[Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Amani National Congress (ANC) rebel MPs are undecided on whether to attend or boycott the party’s National Delegates Conference (NDC) slated for Sunday.  Some lawmakers said they will attend the meeting, while others said it will be a waste of their time.  Matungu MP Peter Nabulindo said he would be at the Bomas of Kenya for the NDC, despite having jumped ship to Azimio La Umoja.  “I will attend the NDC on Sunday and inform my party leader Musalia Mudavadi that the people of Matungu want to join Azimio La Umoja," said Nabulindo.   But Lugari MP Ayub Savula and his Khwisero counterpart Christopher Aseka said they will boycott the meeting.  “I will not be a party to the NDC's misguided resolution. I have already made up my mind to support Raila and Azimio La Umoja,” Savula told The Standard yesterday.  He said Mudavadi has only three options left: “He may decide to go it alone all the way, work with Raila or join forces with DP Ruto. He should make the right decision because any slight mistake could condemn him to oblivion."   By Brian Otieno and Judah Ben-Hur | 3 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 8 hours ago By James Munyeki | 9 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 9 hours ago
