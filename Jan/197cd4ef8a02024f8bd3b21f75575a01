Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi accompanied by his CECM Finance and Economic Planning Murungi Ndai. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  The Laikipia county government will give rebates to manufacturing companies to ease their electricity and distribution costs.  Finance executive Murungi Ndai said the government is supporting businesses and looking to attract investors.  It has listed 18 manufacturing fields that are expected to benefit from the programme.  Under the new programme, manufacturers will receive a 30 per cent refund on their monthly electricity bills, with a ceiling of Sh100,000, and a 50 per cent refund on their annual bills with a ceiling of Sh50,000.   Mr Ndai said the government will foot 30 per cent of the costs of permits and licences local manufacturers incur while distributing their products in other counties.  The move is expected to benefit manufacturers of textiles, apparel, food, beverages, tobacco, leather, wood, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, botanical products, rubber, and plastic.  Also expected to benefit from the rebates are companies that make non-metallic products, electronic, electrical equipment, and machinery for motor vehicles, furniture, mining and quarrying.
