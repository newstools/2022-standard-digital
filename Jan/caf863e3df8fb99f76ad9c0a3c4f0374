DP William Ruto addressing Kehancha town residents, January 9, 2022. [Caleb Kingwara, Standard]  Deputy President William Ruto has asked ODM leader Raila Odinga to come out clear about his development agenda and not to be obsessed with his (Ruto's) monetary contribution to Kenyans.  Ruto said that Raila should not be concerned over his monthly pay versus his contribution to various development projects since what he was giving out was very little money.    He added that the ODM leader should instead embrace giving so that he can get God's blessings. Speaking during public rallies at Isebania border town, Getonganya, Kehancha town, Nyamotambe, Nyabikongori and Wangirabose in Kuria West and Kuria East constituencies in Migori County on Sunday, Ruto said his government will set aside Sh50 billion to empower small businesses across the country annually if elected president.   "I am asking those leaders who are obsessed with my small contributions to Kenyans to state what they have done for Kenyans and leave me alone to continue with my work," said Ruto.  The DP said that Kenyans are going to determine who will be the next president and will not be intimidated by a few wealthy people holding meetings in hotels.  The DP was accompanied by Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Kuria West MP Mathias Robi, Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama, South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro, West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi and Kiambaa MP John Wanjiku among others.   By Mireri Junior | 57 minutes ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 4 hours ago By Stephanie Wangari | 5 hours ago By Standard Team | 6 hours ago Senator Mithika Linturi’s loose tongue ignites political storm
