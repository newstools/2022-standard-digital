We are offering them a token of appreciation for taking the bold move. We have partnered with the Fistula Foundation to offer treatment for one year," said Dr Juma.  Fistula Foundation's Country Director Habiba Mohamed said Vihiga county joins seven other counties offering free fistula treatment.  "We have been urging women to deliver in hospitals as opposed to home without a skilled birth attendant," Habiba noted.   By Jackline Inyanji | 5 hours ago By Omelo Juliet | 9 hours ago By Nathan Ochunge | 1 day ago By Alexander Chagema | 2 days ago KQ pilots push for overhaul of airline's board and management
