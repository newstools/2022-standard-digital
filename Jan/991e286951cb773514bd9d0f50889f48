The suspect allegedly collected Sh160,700 from a city resident in the guise of securing her employment in Poland. [Courtesy]  A businesswoman charged with receiving money by pretence has been freed on Sh200,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh100,000.  Techkla Wanja Njiru, who was arrested on the eve of Christmas, allegedly collected Sh160,700 from a city resident Hatungimana Alimassi Tresor in the guise of securing her employment in Poland.  However, the suspect denied the charge before Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi.  The charge sheet stated that Wanja obtained the money between June 14 2021 and August 5, 2021, in Ngara, Nairobi, with the intent to defraud. When she appeared before the court on Tuesday, Wanja asked the court to order that she be taken back to Central Police Station so she can be able to access her bank account and refund the money.  However, when she returned to court on Wednesday, she told Ochoi that she had not accessed her bank and that the amount stated in the charge sheet was not the same that she received from the complainant.  She however did not tell the court the exact amount she received from him.  The magistrate ordered that she be released on bond and set February 26 as the date the case will be mentioned.  In the same court, one Dedan Waithaka Mwangi was charged with receiving close to Sh2.5 million claiming he was in a position to sell medicine.  But Mwangi denied that between March 27, 2021, and May 10, 2021, in Nairobi CBD, jointly with others not before court committed the offence.  The charge sheet stated that Mwangi received Sh2,495,000 to sell to Gilbert Kipkurui Milgo 36 Herceptin 150mgs vials for intravenous injections well aware he could not deliver.  Mwangi pleaded with the court to release him on favourable bail terms saying he is the sole breadwinner to his family. The father of one told the court they are expecting another baby and that his wife needs him.  "Your honour, I plead with you to release me on an affordable bail as my young family demands care especially now that my wife is expectant with our second-born," Mwangi told Ochoi.  He was released on a bond of Sh500,000 or alternatively a cash bail of Sh300 000.  Mwangi's case will be mentioned on February 1.
