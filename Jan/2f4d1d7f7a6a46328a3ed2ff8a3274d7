Nyandarua County Assembly. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Nyandarua MCAs have pointed out the need to improve the county’s own source of revenue.   Njabini-Kiburu MCA, who chairs the Budget and Appropriation Committee, Kiiru Gachomba said the county relies heavily on funding from the national government while it has unutilised resources.   “In order to achieve our financial targets, we need to come up with better ways to increase funds collected. This is achievable if we make good use of the resources,” Mr Gachomba said.  “A good example is Sasumua dam in Nyandarua which supplies water to Nairobi county, and Lake Olbollosat is the only lake in Central. We should collect funds from such resources for our county’s development.”   Gachomba was presenting the County Budget Review Outlook Paper (CBROP) for Financial Year 2022 to the House.  Wanjohi MCA Isaac Kung’u sought clarification on why the Water and Trade departments received the least funds yet they are crucial departments.   Kanjuiri Ridge MCA Suleiman Kihika, who also chairs the Committee on Finance and Economic Planning, insisted on the need to have fumigation services for the PSVs.  “Public Service Vehicles need to have fumigation certificates but there are no such services in our county. PSV owners are forced to seek those services from the neighbouring Laikipia County,” said Suleiman.   “Such services need to be enacted in the Finance Bill to ensure they are available.”    Suleiman who represented the majority leader, Edinald Wambugu, also tabled the County Fiscal Strategic Paper, the Debt Management Strategic Paper and the Medium-term plan to the floor of the House.   The tabled documents will be interrogated by the Committee on General Oversight.     By Fred Kagonye | 14 hours ago By Timothy Kariuki | 1 day ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 2 days ago By Boniface Gikandi | 3 days ago
