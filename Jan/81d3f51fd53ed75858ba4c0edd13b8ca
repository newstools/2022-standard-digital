Nyandarua County Assembly. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Members of the Nyandarua County Assembly have emphasised the need to minimise flagship projects in a bid to accelerate implementation and successful completion of ongoing projects.   The MCAs spoke yesterday in the House during the adoption of the Annual Development Plan (ADP) for the financial year 2022/2023.  The report on consideration of the development plan was tabled in the assembly by the chairperson of the Budget and Appropriation Committee Kiiru Gachomba.   Wanjohi MCA Isaac Kung'u noted that the current regime had performed poorly in the implementation of flagship projects. "In the ADP, some of the projects identified as flagship do not qualify as such. As the assembly, we resolved that the county only needs to have two or three major projects that we will allocate more money to,” Kung'u said.   Kipipiri MCA Paul Ngeche noted that there are projects in the county that needed priority as they would largely benefit the locals.  "For the past four years, we have been allocating money to flagship projects like the potato factory and the sugar beet factory and we have nothing tangible to show for that money. Let us prioritise projects like the Mashujaa Hospital Complex,” said Ngeche.   Murungaru MCA Kariuki Muchiri pointed out that the local revenue projections were exaggerated and inaccurate.  He noted that in comparison with the previous years, the projections in the ADP for the financial year 2022/2023 were too high.   By Kamore Maina | 41 minutes ago By Phares Mutembei | 3 hours ago By Boniface Gikandi | 16 hours ago By Muriithi Mugo | 1 day ago Uhuru’s shake up plan as CSs plan to quit
