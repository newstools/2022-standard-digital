Police in Mombasa are hunting for a woman identified as Wambui after she allegedly drugged a male victim before robbing him of his cash and other items at a hotel on Saturday night.  Wambui is alleged to have used a stupefying substance to drug her victim at the newly launched VIP Club Volume in Shanzu, Mombasa County before robbing him of his mobile phones, laptop, ATM cards and other valuables.  She left the man in the room unconscious and went to the bank to withdraw Sh596,000 from her bank account.  According to officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the man who was in Mombasa for a business trip met Wambui at Club Volume and asked her to join him in a drinking spree only to fall victim.  “He got attracted to Wambui after she passed by his table in well-calculated strides and he beckoned her to join him,” police said. The two enjoyed their drinks until at around 4am when Wambui told him she was tired and wanted to go rest.  The duo boarded a cab to Seville apartments, where the man had reserved a suite.  According to the victim, they took a shower before they went back to the room where he took a glass of juice that knocked him out a few minutes later.  He passed out only to wake up on Sunday afternoon is when he realised he had been robbed of his cash and valuables.
