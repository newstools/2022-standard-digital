DPP Noordin Haji makes his remarks after winning the Jurist of the Year Award (JOYA), 2021. [Courtesy]  Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has said his office needs adequate evidence to prosecute gender-based violence cases.  Mr Haji noted that most GBV cases involve people who are well known to the victims, and who interfere with evidence that could secure convictions.       “Some complainants in such cases are not courageous enough to lodge their cases,” said Haji. He said his office can only present cases to the Judiciary when they have adequate evidence.  The DPP made the remarks yesterday during the Agnes Tirop Conference organised by the Ministry of Sports in Kwale.  The conference is being held in honour of former cross country champion Agnes Tirop who was brutally murdered at her home in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County in a suspected case of GBV.  Supreme Court Judge Lady Justice Njoki Ndung’u said gender violence has been on the increase especially in sports.  “Parliament needs to pass bills and adopt policies aimed at promoting gender equality and protection from discrimination within sports,” said Ndung’u.  Public Service and Gender CAS Linah Jebii said more needs to be done to address gender abuse.  She said there are 58 rescue centres across the country three of which are managed by government.
