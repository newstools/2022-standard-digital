Eric Obino was yesterday made a Gusii elder at his Bobaracho home. [Sammy Omingo, Standard]  Veteran editor Eric Obino has launched his bid for Nyaribari Chache Constituency seat in Kisii County.  Mr Obino, 54, who has worked in media for 30 years, was yesterday made a Gusii elder and granted powers to lead in a ceremony conducted by Gusii elders at his Bobaracho home.  He said if elected, he will empower residents through various development programmes and make them economically independent.  "The people of Nyaribari Chache are yearning for change. I am ready to offer myself as the next area member of National Assembly, I am calling out for support of residents who want change,'' said Obino. The Mediamax Network Limited Editor-in-Chief promised to give priority to education given that Kisii has land scarcity with the best investment being a good education for the modern world.  He also promised to address the boundary dispute between the constituency which covers a huge section of Kisii town and neighbouring constituencies.  “I will also fight tokenism which has discouraged good leaders from seeking elective seats. Indeed, residents should be wary of political leaders who give them money for one day and leave them suffering for the next five years,” said Obino.  The senior editor said he will seek an ODM ticket and called for free and fair nomination in an election where he will face the incumbent Richard Tongi who is serving a second term.  Other candidates who have shown interest in the seat include businessman Zaheer Jhanda, former Kenya Pipeline chairman James Kenani and Kiogoro MCA Samuel Apoko.
