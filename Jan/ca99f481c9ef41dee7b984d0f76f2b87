Six died at the scene, while two succumbed to their injuries in hospital.  “I send my heartfelt condolences to the journalists’ fraternity and the families of those who lost their loved ones in the Tuesday morning accident,” President Suluhu said in a message posted on her official Twitter page.

The Busega crash comes a week after a truck ploughed into a crowd in Mtwara Region, southern Tanzania, killing 14 on the spot and leaving 22 others injured.  The victims were attending a ceremonial ritual in Lindumbe Village when the accident occurred.
