Deputy President William Ruto speaks during a rally in Migori county on Sunday.  Deputy President William Ruto has broken the silence over alleged utterances made by Meru Senator Mithika Linturi during a campaign trail on Saturday.  The DP also warned members affiliated with the UDA party against spewing hate speech and divisive politics.  "Going forward, I want to tell members of my team, all of us must mind our language and must be careful about what we say so that we can unite this country," Ruto continued.  Speaking during a prayer rally in Bomet county, the DP warned leaders against divisive talks, adding that his United Democratic Alliance is working towards uniting Kenyans. Additionally, the DP stated that the party did not agree with talks that profiled individuals, groups or communities.  "For those who are talking about senator Linturi, he made a statement which he regrets, a statement that had inappropriate language and senator Linturi has apologised. He has withdrawn the statement and he has unconditionally apologised to the people of Kenya," the DP stated.  DP Ruto's statement came days after Linturi was arrested following his remarks during a rally on Saturday.  Speaking to the media during his arrest, the senator stated he would follow the law, adding that he was neither a warlord nor a warmonger.  "I have no record. I only said that those not supporting UDA should be rejected by Uasin Gishu voters and I was misquoted," he stated.  "I am just saying if we are supporting him [Ruto] from Meru and the Mt Kenya region, then the likes of MPs Kutuny, Kamar, and Mishra should not be re-elected,” Linturi told an editor at The Standard.
