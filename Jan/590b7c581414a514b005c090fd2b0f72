A businesswoman accused of evading tax worth Sh6.7 billion has been allowed to travel to Turkey to inspect furniture she intends to import.  Anti-Corruption Court Chief Magistrate Felix Kombo said the fact that Mary Wambui is facing a serious charge of tax evasion should not limit her freedom of movement. He dismissed claims that she is likely to relocate.  “In any case, there are mechanisms which will be used for her return if she flees,” Kombo said.  The magistrate, however, directed Wambui to provide a surety of Sh3 million to guarantee her return. Wambui, her daughter Purity Njoki Mungai and their company Purma Holdings Limited were last month charged with several counts of tax evasion. They were released on a cash bail of Sh25 million with condition that they surrender their passports and not travel abroad without the court’s permission.  She had on Monday made an application for release of the passport, saying she is required to travel to Turkey.  But the prosecution opposed the request, saying her past conduct, where she evaded arrest despite court summons, proved she is prepared to flee.
