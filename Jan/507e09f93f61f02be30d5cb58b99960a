[Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi has dismissed claims that he will withdraw from the Nairobi governor’s race.  Mr Wanyonyi said he was focused on clinching the city’s top job.    The MP, while presenting his 10-point agenda for the city, said voters should be left to choose a candidate who would cater for their needs. He spoke after meeting with Church and Clergy Association of Kenya members in Nairobi yesterday. “Some of my competitors who are already sensing defeat are busy spreading propaganda that I will step down for someone else. I am in this race to the end,” he said  The MP who will vie for the seat on ODM ticket said as much as various regions are in support of Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja movement, leaders should not chest thumb and give conditions.  He was reacting to claims that Mt Kenya leaders in support of Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja were pushing to have a candidate from the region given a direct ticket for Nairobi governorship. He said elective positions should not be sacrificial.      By Gilbert Kimutai and Nikko Tanui | 1 hour ago By Paul Ogemba | 1 hour ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 2 hours ago By Eric Abuga | 2 hours ago DP William Ruto feels heat over Mithika Linturi, whips allies
