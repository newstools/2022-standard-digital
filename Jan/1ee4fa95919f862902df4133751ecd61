Mr Okiring said the man from Kisumu followed the woman to her matrimonial home in Migori, before they were later found dead.  “The woman recently reunited with her first husband. A brother of her first husband brought her back from Kisumu and built her a house, where she was found dead with Guya,” said Okiring.  Relatives said the man followed Atieno to Rongo and was received by her relative, who directed him to the new home.  Relatives said they were shocked family members directed the man to the house.
