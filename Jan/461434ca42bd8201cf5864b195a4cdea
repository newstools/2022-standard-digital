One Kenya Alliance (OKA) Principal Moses Wetangula. [Stafford Ondego, Standard]  Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has urged the government to lower the prices of fertilisers ahead of the next planting season.  The Ford Kenya leader regretted that many farmers were facing harsh economic times and some were unable to purchase fertilisers due to the high prices.  Speaking in Webuye East constituency, Wetang’ula noted that the region greatly depends on agriculture as its means of livelihood.  “If the government doesn’t lower the fertiliser prices, then most farmers in the region will be unable to engage in farming, and this will lead to food shortage,” he said. Touching on the issue of long truck queues along the Bungoma-Malaba highway, he said that the situation is a risk to the residents, and asked the government move with speed and settle the stalemate at the Kenya-Uganda border.  “Some of these trucks parked along the highway are ferrying dangerous goods that pose a risk to the residents,” said Wetang’ula, adding that some of the lorries are carrying petroleum which is inflammable.   By Nathan Ochunge | 12 hours ago By Osinde Obare | 1 day ago By Alexander Chagema | 1 day ago By Biketi Kikechi | 1 day ago
