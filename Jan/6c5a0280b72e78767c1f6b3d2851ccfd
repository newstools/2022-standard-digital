Part of the money seized by KRA customs officers at JKIA. [Courtesy]  Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Customs officers have arrested a foreigner at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on suspicion of involvement in a money-laundering scheme.  The foreigner, a Bahraini national identified as Khalid Jameel Saeed, was intercepted at JKIA with $975,000 (Sh110,760,000) in cash.  KRA, in a statement, said the foreigner was on transit to Bahrain through Egyptian Airlines.  “The alert was that the passenger had earlier made several attempts to deposit the currency in a bank but had failed,” KRA noted. His arrest follows security beef-up in the country after the Dutch, German and French embassies in Kenya issued terror alerts yesterday.  Police Spokesperson Bruno Shioso has since called for vigilance from members of the public.  “We urge the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities through our toll-free numbers: 999, 911, 112, and 0800722203,” said Shioso.  On Friday, the US Embassy also warned of imminent terror activities in Kenya, asking its citizens to “exercise vigilance at public events, places of worship, and locations with large crowds.”  French, Dutch, and the UK embassies in Kenya last night warned their citizens against planned terror attacks in Nairobi, North Eastern, and the Kenyan Coast.
