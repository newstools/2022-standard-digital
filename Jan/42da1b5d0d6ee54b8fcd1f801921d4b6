The four are being held at the JKIA police station. [Courtesy]  A Nairobi-based US businessman and his three employees have been taken into custody for allegedly issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to travellers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.  This comes weeks since the Middle East issued Kenya with a red notice after some travellers from Kenya were found in possession of fake Covid-19 Certificates.  The owner of Checkup Medical Center, Dr Moka Lantun was arrested at his business premises at around midday by officers allegedly from the Ministry of Health.  While confirming their arrests, Dr Moka told The Standard that they were being held at JKIA Police Station, awaiting arraignment on Thursday, January 25 morning. “Ministry of Health officials led by one Patrick came to our premises at mid-morning. They have not shown us any documentation but went through our files and data, combing through every part of the facility,” Dr Moka said in a phone interview.  Dr Moka also said that on December 21, 2021, they had been given a letter by the Ministry of Health suspending the activities at the facility.  On Thursday, January 13, the facility suspended its activities temporarily as was ordered by the Ministry but says they moved to court to challenge the suspension.  The case is ongoing.  A day later, the Acting Director-General at the Ministry, Patrick Amoth, wrote to Checkups and banned them from issuing trusted travel codes for travellers and suspended Covid-19 testing at the facility for three months.  The reason, according to Amoth’s letter dated January 14, was faults and errors noted by officers from Afya House who had inspected the premises prior.  The ministry also warned that the facility was subject to an audit that would check whether the faults identified had been corrected.
