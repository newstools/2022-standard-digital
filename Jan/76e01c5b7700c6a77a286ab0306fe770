ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi addressing faithful at St Faith ACK Church, Ongata Rongai. January 30, 2022. [Courtesy]  Kenyans will have to wait a bit longer to know who will be the Kenya Kwanza Alliance presidential candidate for the August 9 General Election.  Addressing the media after a church service at St Faith Parish, ACK in Rongai, today, Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi said picking the candidate was work in progress.    The coalition brings together Deputy President William Ruto's United Democratic Alliance, ANC and Moses Wetang'ula's Ford-Kenya. Mudavadi said the alliance’s task at the moment is to unite Kenyans and ensure peaceful elections.  “Yes, ultimately we shall name the candidate who will fly the Kenya Kwanza flag in the elections. However, at the moment our priority is to unite Kenyans and ensure we have a peaceful election,” he said.  Defended his decision  Mudavadi defended his decision to team up with Ruto saying it was well thought out after wide consultations within ANC.  "ANC party is going to the August 9 elections with a clarion call of reviving the economy through renegotiating and rescheduling of the country’s public debts," said the ANC leader.  Under the Uchumi Bora, Pesa Mfukoni clarion call, ANC has synchronised its call with UDA's bottom-up economic model where it will seek to empower the most affected Kenyans through interest-free loans and grants to jump-start businesses.  Mudavadi maintained that he joined hands with Ruto after the realisation that the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) where he was a co-principal with Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper party, Gideon Moi of Kanu and Wetangula, was a government project meant to stall his ambitions.
