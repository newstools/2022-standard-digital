A group of youths want ODM to endorse Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi (pictured) for Nairobi governor.  The group dubbed mobilisers said Wanyonyi is the only ODM member who has declared interest in the seat.  Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, the youths, warned against any negotiations on the MP's candidature, throwing a spanner in the works of ODM leader Raila Odinga’s plans for consensus during nominations.  “Our irreducible minimum as the Mulembe community is the Nairobi governorship. Nyanza will get the presidency and Mt Kenya the deputy president. No one can sit in a boardroom and decide our candidate for us,” said Vincent Shimoli.   Shimoli urged ODM to conduct nominations through secret ballot.  “We cannot go to the table and come out empty-handed. We don’t mind consultations but they will lead to the same outcome – a Wanyonyi candidature,” said Hudson Ndeda.  Wanyonyi could face off against Makadara MP George Aladwa, Governor Anne Kananu, former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, business persons Richard Ngatia and Anne Kagure within the Azimio la Umoja Movement.    By Philip Muasya | 1 hour ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 1 hour ago By Jacob Ng'etich | 5 hours ago By Ndungu Gachane | 5 hours ago
