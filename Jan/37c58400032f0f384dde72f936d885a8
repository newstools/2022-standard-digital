Abdirahim Adow Abdulahi's wife Rahma Abdul at iten morgue in Elgeyo Marakwet on January 24, 2022.[Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  The disappearance and subsequent murder of a Directorate of Criminal Investigations officer is a stark reminder that our security is deteriorating rapidly.  Abdirahim Adow Abdulahi’s body was found dumped near Kolol viewpoint, along the border of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties, 400km from his work station in Embu County.  His killing comes at a time when Kenyans are still tongue-tied over the discovery of more than 20 bodies of unknown persons in Yala River. Life has become extremely cheap in this country.  When Kenyans, including security officers who should be protecting us, are abducted killed and the killers are rarely apprehended, those in charge of security must be asked tough questions. Kenyans would like to know what exactly is happening and whether our security agencies are up to the task.
