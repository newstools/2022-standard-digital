I have this afternoon, Sunday January 2, 2022, received with deep sorrow the sad news of the passing away of Dr Richard Erskine Frere Leakey, Kenya's former Head of Public Service.  Dr Leakey, a globally renowned Kenyan paleoanthropologist and conservationist, has over the years served our country with distinction in several public service roles among them as Director of the National Museums of Kenya and Chairman of the Kenya Wildlife Service Board of Directors.  Besides his distinguished career in the public service, Dr Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya's vibrant civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions among them the conservation organization WildlifeDirect.  On behalf of the people of Kenya, my family and on my own behalf, I send heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the family, friends and associates of Dr. Richard Leakey during this difficult period of mourning.  May God the Almighty grant the soul of Dr Richard Leakey eternal rest.     By Barrack Muluka | 25 minutes ago By Njonjo Kihuria | 5 hours ago By Njonjo Kihuria | 6 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 7 hours ago Junior secondary headache may persist this year
