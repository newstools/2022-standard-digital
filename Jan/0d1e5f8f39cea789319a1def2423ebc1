[Courtesy]  The High Court in Nairobi was treated to drama over the whereabouts of a college student at the centre of a Sh102 million money-laundering scheme.  This happened as six lawyers from two different firms fought to represent 21-year-old Felista Nyamathira Njoroge, who is suspected to be part of an international syndicate with her Belgian boyfriend Marc De Mesel.  Whereas one set of lawyers claimed the student is in the country and that they took her to the Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) to record a statement, the other law firm said the student is out of the country and is expectant.  Trouble started when lawyer Thomas Maosa told Justice Esther Maina that they have instructions from Njoroge to represent her and had gone ahead to file submissions on her defence.   Maosa, who appeared alongside PLO Lumumba and a Mr Nyangoro claimed they had presented her to ARA to record a statement on how she received money from the Belgian.  “Njoroge instructed us to represent her and we don’t know where the other lawyers are coming from. We are ready to confirm she is in the country,” said Maosa.  But the other lawyers led by Walter Owaga claimed they had instructions to represent the Nairobi Technical Training Institute student.  “The real Felista is out of the country and she is heavily pregnant. We shall take instructions guided by her doctor and avail evidence of her pregnancy,” said Owaga.  Justice Maina ordered the lawyers to present the person they claim to be the student at the DCI.  Further hearings are set for May 16 when the DCI are expected to present a report on Njoroge.      By Elvince Joshua | 14 minutes ago By Robert Amalemba | 30 minutes ago By Mireri Junior | 55 minutes ago By Kamau Muthoni | 3 hours ago
