Businessman Suleiman Shahbal. [Omondi Onyango, Standard]  Businessman Suleiman Shahbal is banking on his managerial skills to revive the ailing Mombasa economy and create jobs if elected governor.  Addressing residents in Kongowea ward, Nyali sub-county yesterday, Mr Shahbal said he is not a politician but a manager.  “I am not a politician but a manager. I have not served as MCA, MP, senator or governor but I have managed to create 3,000 jobs. I believe a can create 10,000 jobs every year by wooing investors to Mombasa if elected the next governor,” he said.   He was referring to the creation of jobs through the ongoing construction of Sh6 billion houses in Buxton estate by his firm Buxton Point Apartment. The businessman is associated with Gulf African Bank and Gulf Energy among other investments.  Shahbal will battle it out with Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo, deputy governor William Kingi, former Mombasa senator Hassan Omar and former Nyali MP Awiti Bollo in the race to succeed Governor Hassan Joho.  The businessman will face off Mr Nassir and Dr Kingi for the ODM ticket. He decamped from Jubilee Party to ODM in June last year.  Joho and ODM leader Raila Odinga have not endorsed any politician for Mombasa governor.  Shahbal exuded confidence that he will succeed Joho.  “I can plan for the next five to 10 years and hence the best bet to change the economy of this county. In 2022 we are going to win. Let them bring any project and we will rule over it,” he said.  Nassir addressed rallies in Likoni sub-county where he got the endorsement of local elders.  The MP who was flanked by Likoni MP Mishi Mboko is banking on his political experience to win the seat.  Kingi last week got the endorsement of Mijikenda kaya elders during a traditional ceremony inside Kaya Kinondo in Kwale County.
