Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga [Kibata Kihu, Standard]  Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has reorganised his Cabinet after two of his executives resigned.  Health Executive Racheal Kamau and Kwai Wanjaria, who headed Lands, Urbanisation and Physical Planning, separately notified Mr Kahiga that they were leaving to pursue other interests.  Finance Executive Robert Thuo will take over the Health docket in acting capacity while Beth Karimi, who was in charge of Public Service and Sanitation, will take over the Department of Physical Planning.  Public Service and Sanitation will now be headed by Education Executive Margaret Macharia in an acting capacity. Kahiga said his government had advertised for the position of Health executive and that of Public Service and Sanitation.      Trade, Tourism and Cooperatives Chief Officer Adan Aden has also been moved to the Health Department in an acting capacity.  “Despite having the largest share in the county’s budget, the Health Department has had a series of issues in the recent past,” said Kahiga.     By Lydiah Nyawira | 4 hours ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 18 hours ago By Wainaina Ndung’u | 21 hours ago By Muriithi Mugo | 1 day ago Mistrust rocks 'third force' OKA as Ruto, Raila woo principals
