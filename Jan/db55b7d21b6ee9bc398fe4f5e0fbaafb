Reports indicate thirteen killed by IED in Mandera. [File, Standard]  About thirteen people have been confirmed dead in Arabia, Mandera County after a minibus ran over an Improvised Explosive Device (IED).  County authorities have told The Standard that the vehicle was headed to Mandera town.  Eye witnesses at the scene say the incident took place on Monday, January 31, at around 6am.  Over the weekend, the US Embassy issued a terror alert in Kenya, urging vigilance in public places hours. That was hours after the government had announced heightened security to forestall possible terror threats.  Prior to that, the Dutch, German, French and UK consulates in the country issued a similar warning on Thursday, January 27.   “There is the potential for increased crime and acts of violent extremism in Kenya this time of year. The US Embassy reminds the public of the continued need for sustained vigilance in public locations such as shopping malls, hotels, airports, clubs, restaurants, transportation hubs, schools, places of worship and other areas frequented by tourists,” the Embassy said on its official website on Friday, January 28.  “Public events, such as demonstrations and celebratory gatherings, are also at a higher risk for violence,” said the American consulate.  To reduce the risk of exposure, the US advised its citizens to “exercise vigilance at events, places of worship, and locations with large crowds; review personal security plans and monitor local media for updates”.  After the UK, Dutch, German and French embassies in Kenya issued terror alerts on Thursday, Kenya’s National Police Service on Friday said it had heightened security surveillance countrywide.     By Beldeen Waliaula | 6 days ago By Abdimalik Hajir | 6 days ago By Stephanie Wangari | 12 days ago By Esther Dianah | 16 days ago
