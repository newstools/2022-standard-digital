A man allegedly beat and strangled his sister's triplets, causing the death of two, in Kiminini sub-county, Trans Nzoia County.  The triplets, all girls, were aged three.  Kiminini OCPD Joseph Tumbo said the suspect reportedly locked himself in the room where the three girls were sleeping and attacked them.  The incident happened at Mbao farm near Kiminini town. The triplets' mother Margaret Wafula was watching a television programme with her mother when the man sneaked into the room and attacked the children.  The two women raised an alarm and neighbours who responded to their distress call rushed the victims to Cottage Hospital in Kiminini where one was pronounced dead on arrival.  The two other girls were referred to Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital where the second one passed on while the third was admitted in critical condition.  The dead children were buried on Wednesday night according to Bukusu customs.  The triplets' father George Wanyonyi said he is yet to understand why his brother-in-law decided to assault the children.  Kiminini OCPD said the suspect had been mentally assessed and confirmed to be fit to stand trial  By Lucas Ngasike | 2 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 2 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 13 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 13 hours ago
