The four, aged between 14 and 18, were arrested at Pungu Villa. [Jonah Onyango, Standard]  Police have arrested four youth suspected to be members of a criminal gang that has been terrorising residents of Likoni in Mombasa.  The four, aged between 14 and 18, were arrested at Pungu Villa.  They were found in possession of 30 mobile phones, a TV set and laptops, which the police believe were stolen properties.  “We recovered uniforms that belong to the National Youth Service, machetes and metal bars from one of the suspect's house,” said Likoni sub-county police commander Joseph Karanja. Karanja identified the suspects as 18-year-old Webuye Ochieng’, Issa Salim, 16, Rashid Hamisi, 14, and Brian Yubah, 17.  Police arrested the four in a house believed to be owned by Webuye.  Karanja said the four belonged to one of the gangs terrorising residents since 2020.  He said the suspects were being interrogated.  “They are in police custody as we carry out investigations to establish the owners of the phones and other gadgets recovered,” said Karanja.
