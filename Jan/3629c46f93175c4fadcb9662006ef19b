Amani National Congress (ANC) has resolved that their party leader Musalia Mudavadi will not sacrifice his presidential ambitions for Deputy President William Ruto candidature.  During the party’s Parliamentary Group meeting where Mudavadi was present, ANC MPs maintained that Ruto’s presence in the party’s National Delegates Conference (NDC) on January 23 should not be interpreted as support for the DP’s presidential bid.  They said the move during the NDC was just the first step of pulling in more partners they can work with to propel ANC campaign ahead of the August 9 election.  “Musalia Mudavadi remains our party’s presidential candidate and we have presented him to Kenyans and nothing is going to stop that. Let it be known that as a party, we have agreed that Mudavadi is going for nothing less than the presidency,” said Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba.   However, he said Mudavadi’s “earthquake” dealt One Kenya Alliance (OKA) a tough blow that fractured the outfit whose principals Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, had plans of working together towards the elections.  ANC is holding a joint rally with UDA today as it launches its campaigns to different parts of the country including rallies in Bungoma County on Friday, January 28.  The party also announced a campaign programme starting today.  jisrael@standardmedia.co.ke     By Kennedy Gachuhi and Julius Chepkwony | 42 minutes ago By Winfrey Owino | 2 hours ago By Brian Okoth | 5 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 7 hours ago
