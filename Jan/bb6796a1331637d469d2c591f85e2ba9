A screenshot of Members of Parliament exchanging kicks and blows during a special sitting last week.  The circus witnessed in Parliament last week where MPs exchanged brickbats past midnight continues tomorrow as a divided House resumes debate on the controversial Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021.  The Standard has established that lawmakers allied to Deputy President William Ruto have filed new multiple amendments in their wider scheme to derail the passage of the coalition Bill.    Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai said that at least six MPs allied to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) have by today morning filed additional amendments. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said that UDA has lined up about 50 new amendments to the Bill.  The new development points to a scheme to maintain political grandstanding on the floor of the National Assembly.  The House has convened for a special sitting tomorrow, Thursday and Friday to consider the Bill that has become a new battlefront pitting President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on one side against the DP.     By Grace Ng'ang'a | 1 hour ago By Nathan Ochunge | 1 hour ago By Nathan Ochunge | 1 hour ago By Stephen Rutto | 15 hours ago Electricity bills go up despite Uhuru's cheap power promise
