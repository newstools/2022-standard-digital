Migori Suna Marindi market traders wash fish with polluted water from River Migori on January 7, 2022. [Caleb Kingwara, Standard]  Migori town residents have expressed fear of disease outbreaks following water shortage in the county for the last three months.  Marindi market traders led by Millicent Achieng, said that locals are eating fish washed with polluted water from River Migori as they have no alternative sources of water.  Achieng said traders depend on the river's water that is contaminated with filth from the market centres.  “We have no access to clean water since all taps within the market and its surrounding areas are dry, but when we  inquire from Migori county water department, we are told to be patient," Achieng said. The traders are now asking the governor to come to their aid as their businesses are suffering.
