A few days after ditching Deputy President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party, Kirinyaga Woman Rep Wangui Ngirici has removed UDA colours from her offices in Kerugoya town.  The offices which had yellow and green, the domiant UDA colours with the wheelbarrow, the party’s symbol, have now been repainted in white colour.  The Kirinyaga Governor seat aspirant also removed the UDA colours from her public address lorry and campaign vehicles Ngirici’s supporters spent the better part of Monday removing the colours from the office and from the vehicles.  While announcing her departure from UDA, the woman Representative said that she is sure that the party will not offer her a free and fair nominations process.  “The ‘party owners’ called me to Nairobi where they told me to vie for the Mwea parliamentary seat and shelve my gubernatorial ambitions in favour of Governor Ann Waiguru,” she told residents of Mwea and Gichugu.  The legislator noted that having declared their preference, she is assured that the party will not give her the certificate even if she trounces Governor Ann Waiguru at the party primaries.  Ngirici said that she will be moving from one village to another telling voters that it is the individual that matters and not the political party that matters  “Some of my competitors have already used millions to buy nominations certificates, but I have decided that I will not donate anything to the party but will instead use that money to better the lives of my constituents,” she said.  Ngirici said her political future and that of Kirinyaga residents will not be determined by a few individuals, but will be determined by the voters at the ballot.
