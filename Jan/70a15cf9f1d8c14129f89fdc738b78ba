An AK-47 rifle. [Courtesy]  The police are pursuing a 41-year-old man who fled after he was found in possession of an AK-47 rifle.  According to identification documents, the suspect comes from Kerio Valley, Elgeyo Marakwet, an area that has faced perennial insecurity.  Jonathan Rono, the local administrator, claimed the man was reportedly heading to Kisumu but alighted to spend the night on Friday at Potopoto market centre, Tindiret.  "From the locals and boda boda operators who encountered him, the suspect is said to have alighted at Kobere centre and boarded another motorbike to Potopoto centre for an overnight stay," he said. While at Potopoto, the suspect is said to have checked into a lodging at the shopping centre at around 7pm and made payment for one night.  The traveller seemed hesitant to allow the lodging attendant to frisk his bag after submitting his national ID.  "The attendant opened the bag where she found clothes and a metallic object under the clothes," said Rono.  On further checking, she found it was a gun. The startled attendant raised an alarm and the client took off.  Abdulahi Jire, Tindiret sub-county police commander, confirmed that the gun was collected from the guest house, including some academic documents.   By Caroline Chebet | 15 hours ago By Josphat Kinyanjui | 1 day ago By Obare Osinde | 1 day ago By Edward Kosut | 2 days ago Raila: State project or change in strategy?
