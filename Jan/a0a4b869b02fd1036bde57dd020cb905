[Courtesy]  Former senior LinkedIn manager Thogori Chege Karago was found dead at a hotel in Westlands, Nairobi on Friday, January 21.  Karago, 33, was found in her room on the hotel’s third floor.  The door to her room had been locked from the inside, and attendants had to break it down to gain access.  Police were called to the scene, where they removed Karago’s body and took it to a nearby morgue at 5pm. Kilimani Sub-County Police Commander Muturi Mbogo told The Standard that there were no physical injuries on Karago’s body.  “We found some medicine in her room. It is suspected she had a blood clot in the brain,” said Mbogo.  A postmortem conducted on Karago indicated that the results were “inconclusive”.  “Her samples were taken for further analysis,” said Mbogo.  Karago served as LinkedIn’s Head of Research and Development for Africa region for four years, between 2014 and 2018.  She also served at the company as the senior product manager between 2016 and 2017.  Prior to joining LinkedIn, she served as an advisory Board Member for Xerox, a production print technology company headquartered in New York, USA. She served in that capacity for six years, starting August 2012 to August 2018.  After exiting LinkedIn, Karago ventured into private practice, establishing SpeakEasy, a platform that provides an avenue for content creation, with a priority given to women and children.  “We connect them with production resources, coaching and funding opportunities within our network with a goal of enabling them to turn their organic engagement into monetisation,” she said on her website bio.
