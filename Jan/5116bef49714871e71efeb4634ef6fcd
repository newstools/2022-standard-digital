The body of a woman was found stashed in a suitcase and dumped near the GSU Recce barracks in Kimbo, Kiambu County, on Monday.  Juja police commander Dorothy Miragusha said preliminary investigations suggest the woman, aged between 18 and 20, was strangled.  “The body was wrapped in a nylon sack and stashed in a black suitcase. Her hands were tied at the back while her legs were bound together using a manila rope. A nylon string was tied around her neck,” read a police report filed at the Mugutha Police Station.  “She had a deep cut injury on her left breast,” says the report. The public became curious when the suitcase remained on the road unclaimed for two hours.    Miragusha said a message that takes the form of a revenge note was written on the woman’s breasts, thighs and palms.  “The message said: ‘Bwana ya mtu sumu (dating someone’s husband is akin to taking poison)," said Miragusha.  The message had been written using a blue marker pen. The police said no arrests had been made in connection with the murder.  Miragusha said preliminary probe indicates the young woman was killed elsewhere and her body dumped in Kimbo. The woman’s body was taken to the City Mortuary. The police plan to process her fingerprints to establish her identity.
