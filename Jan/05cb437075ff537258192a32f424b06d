The convict will serve the 20-year jail term at the Embu GK Prison. [File, Standard]  A man in his forties has been sentenced by the Embu Law Courts to 20 years in jail for sodomising his 57-year-old brother.  The accused committed the crime on April 3, 2020 at Njoguini Village in Embu North Sub-County.  The court found the suspect guilty of sexually abusing his mentally ill elder brother, despite his plea of innocence.  He was also sentenced to three years in jail for threatening to kill another person. The sentences will run concurrently, the court ruled. Embu Senior Resident Magistrate Tony Kwambai stated that the court established, through a medical report submitted by the Prosecution, that the victim was living with a mental illness.  The convict will serve the two-decade jail term at the Embu GK Prison.  By Stephen Nzioka | 19 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 2 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 3 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 3 days ago
