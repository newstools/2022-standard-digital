A man accused of killing his wife and four children last November in Kathata Village in Kirinyaga East Sub-county today denied five charges of murder.  Paul Murage Njuki denied the charges when he appeared before High Court judge Richard Mwongo in Kerugoya.   He was accused of murdering, on the night of November 28, 2021, his 38-year-old wife Millicent Muthoni, his daughters Nelly Wawira 13, and Shelmith Wambui, 5, as well as sons Gifton Bundi, 7, and Clifton Murage, 1.  The suspect, through his State-assigned lawyer Heyi Bruno, applied to be released on bond, a plea that was opposed by State prosecutor Vincent Mamba.   The prosecution said the probation officer is yet to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of his possible release.  The court directed the probation officer to submit a report within 14 days.  Justice Mwongo ordered the accused be remanded at Kerugoya GK Prison until February 28 when the case will be mentioned.   By Fidelis Kabunyi | 1 day ago By Boniface Gikandi | 2 days ago By Kamore Maina | 3 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 3 days ago
