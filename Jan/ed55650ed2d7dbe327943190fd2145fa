The project will be administered by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (Rerec). [Omondi Onyango, Standard]  Thirty-six counties in eight regions are set to benefit from a Sh6.4 billion rural electrification programme scheduled to be completed in June.  The project will be administered by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (Rerec).  The scope of the project includes construction of 2,850 kilometres of power distribution lines and installation of transformers.  Rerec envisages connecting 1,200 public installations, including market, administration and health centres, schools, tea buying centres and coffee factories. Known as the Electrification for Public Facilities Project, the programme aims to also light up some 34,460 households in the targeted regions.  Rerec board chairman Simon Gicharu said the project will spur economic growth at the grassroots.  The areas set to benefit include Coast, Nyanza, western Kenya, north and south Rift, central Kenya, upper and lower Eastern.  In total, 131 constituencies in 36 counties will benefit.  Rerec Chief Executive Officer Peter Mbugua said in each of the project areas, over 7,000 households will be connected to power supply.  The government and its partners, including the Arab Bank for Economic Development, OPEC Fund for Development, Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and Saudi Fund for Development are jointly financing of the project.  Tana River Woman Representative Rehema Hassan said the project will help improve the living standards of the locals and ensure social services are available.
