Preparations to put up a perimeter fence at Murang’a County Assembly costing Sh27 million on January 17, 2022 [Boniface Gikandi, Standard]  Murang’a County Assembly will spend Sh27.65 million on a perimeter fence to enforce security within the precincts seven months to the General Election.  Funds allocated to the project were passed in the assembly in 2018, and the process to erect the permanent fence started on Monday, a month after the tendering process was concluded.  The project includes the main gate and guards’ office among other security requirements outlined in the contract tender. Speaker of the Assembly Nduati Kariuki confirmed the fencing, saying it will provide security in the precincts, for the members and the general public.  Kariuki said the project will be implemented after the assembly procurement committee went through the process and picked the best contractor who met the requirements set.  “The multi-million shillings project has started and the office of the clerk will be working to ensure the timely completion,” said the speaker.
