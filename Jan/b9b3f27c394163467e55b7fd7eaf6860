Covered dead body [Courtesy]  A 21-year-old man drowned in a dam in Mitoto village.  Andrew Sifuma reportedly slipped into a water reservoir when he went to collect a generator.  The reservoir was constructed by the family for irrigation during dry spells.  Esther Nyambura, mother to the deceased, had finished pumping water and asked Sifuma to carry the machine home. He failed to return and the family found his cap and sandals in the water. Kiminini OCPD Joseph Tumbo said they are investigating the incident.     By Martin Ndiema | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago By Mercy Kahenda | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 1 day ago
