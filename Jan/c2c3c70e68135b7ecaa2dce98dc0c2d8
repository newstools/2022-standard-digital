The National Assembly. [Courtesy]  Members of Parliament will convene on Tuesday next week to avert a crisis caused by the rejection of a motion to reconstitute the House Business Committee.  The rejection threw the House into paralysis since it implied that the National Assembly could not transact any business, which could stall government operations.  Yesterday, National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya and his Minority counterpart John Mbadi wrote to Speaker Justin Muturi seeking to reverse the decision.  The leadership made the communication following a crisis meeting on Tuesday evening after allies of Deputy President William Ruto pulled a surprise move and rejected names to the crucial committee. Ruto-allied MPs joined forces with lawmakers from Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetangu’la to vote against the motion.  Earlier Speaker Muturi had instructed National Assembly Clerk Michael Silai to prepare Order Paper for today when the House was expected to convene.
