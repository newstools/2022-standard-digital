Moments before a 33-seater matatu lost control then plunged into Total petrol station in Gigiri. [Courtesy]  A Total fuel station attendant died, while another sustained injuries after a 33-seater matatu veered off the road and ploughed into them on Thursday, January 20.  The accident occurred at Rosslyn in Gigiri, Nairobi.  CCTV recording of the 11:49am incident showed two female petrol station attendants serving a motorist when the incident occurred.  One of the women died, while the other was taken to hospital injured. “The body of the attendant who died was taken to Kihara Level 4 Hospital morgue in Kiambu,” Karuri Sub-County Police Commander Phineas Mutwiri told The Standard.  He said they’ve launched a hunt for the driver of the killer matatu, which belongs to Ruaka Sacco.  Abdi Hakim, the manager of Total Energies, Rosslyn branch said the driver escaped during rescue and fire containment efforts.  “He fled while we were trying to avert a bigger tragedy,” said Hakim.  “One of our staff members died after she was crushed in the ribs and legs, while the injured was taken to Aga Khan Hospital, where she was treated and discharged,” added the Total station manager.  Police say they are yet to establish what caused the vehicle to hurtle off the road, though they’re suspecting brake system failure.  Ruaka Sacco chairperson, Steve Njoro, said they’re yet to establish the driver’s whereabouts, as his cellphone line remains unreachable.  “We also don’t know where he is,” he said.  “However, we pledge to cooperate with the police. We have his documents, including a copy of his identification card, driver’s license, among others.”  A boda boda rider, identified only as Emmanuel, who witnessed the accident, said the area has been prone to crashes, and urged motorists to exercise caution.
