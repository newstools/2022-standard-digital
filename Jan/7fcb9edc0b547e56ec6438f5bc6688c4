A section of Thika Road [Courtesy]  A section of the Thika-Garissa Road will be closed for 77 days, starting Wednesday, January 19, to allow for the construction of a box culvert at Kathuluni River, Machakos County.  The Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) says motorists will consequently use diversions that have already been set up.  KENHA Director-General Kungu Ndung’u said the nearly-three-month construction will end on April 5.  Box culverts are used to assist with drainage during rainy seasons. They are rectangular in shape and are generally constructed using concrete. A box culvert under construction.

Liboi is located 179kms from Garissa Town.  The route is often used by long distance truck drivers who transport cargo to the far-flung north-eastern counties, and even into Somalia.  Passengers shuttling between Nairobi and Garissa also frequent the route.
