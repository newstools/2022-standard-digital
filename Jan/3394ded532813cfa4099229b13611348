Matungulu MP Stephen Mule and his Mavoko counterpart, Patrick Makau have said Amani National Congress (ANC) leader, Musalia Mudavadi is a political traitor who cannot be trusted with the country's leadership.  Speaking after laying a foundation stone for the Kenya Medical Training Centre at Matuu ma Mwiitu shopping center in Matungulu constituency, yesterday, Mule and Makau said the ANC leader's decision to team up with Deputy President William Ruto was political betrayal.  The MPs who defended Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Kanu Chairman, Gideon Moi's decision to storm out of ANC National Delegates Congress at Bomas of Kenya claimed that Mudavadi's was Ruto's mole in the One Kenya Alliance (OKA).  They said OKA was intact despite the ANC leaders exit.  "For many years I have said Mudavadi is not a serious chap. After promising Kenyans to expect a "political earthquake", he only ended up joining the wheelbarrow team. This is a betrayal of Kenyans. And we are urging Kalonzo to soldier on and and become OKA's presidential flag bearer," said Makau. The Mavoko legislator maintained that OKA will carry on with the quest to produce President Uhuru Kenyatta's successor.  Mule termed Mudavadi a joker who has failed millions of Kenyans.  "Kenyans will never trust Mudavadi ever again. He has betrayed Kalonzo, Gideon and Wetang'ula. His action marks the beginning of the end of his political career," he said.  The Matungulu MP said OKA will now focus on building Kalonzo's presidential candidature in the August 9, General Election. ?   By Jacob Ng’etich | 54 minutes ago By Winfrey Owino | 3 hours ago By Oscar Obonyo | 4 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 4 hours ago Musalia: Was it an earthquake or just a tremor at his feet?
