[George Kaimenyi, Standard]  Meru's Archbishop Samson Muthuri has taken over as the head of the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA).  Archbishop Muthuri will serve as the presiding bishop for one year, according to leadership pact that he signed in 2020 with two rivals.  The ordination ceremony was held at AIPCA St Nicholas Kithaku in Imenti Central, Meru County.  Those present included Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, Senator Mithika Linturi and Central Imenti MP Moses Kirima. Muthuri signed a pact with his rivals, archbishops Amos Njoroge and Fredrick Wang'ombe, in a deal that was arbitrated by President Uhuru Kenyatta.  Bishop Njoroge immediately took the reins and has now handed over the rotational leadership to Muthuri who will be in charge for the next year before handing over to Wang'ombe.  The deal that settled the feuds in the church was arrived at during mediation talks attended by, among others, MP Kirima who is one of the two chancellors of the AIPCA. The other is Nyeri lawyer Wahome Gikonyo.  The Sunday's ordination ceremony was attended by AIPCA National Chairman Paul Gichu, his assistant David Gichuru, Secretary-General Bernard Maina, his assistant Jacob Nderitu and National Treasurer Salesio Muringi, among others.  Senator Linturi said local political leaders will offer support to the church for it to grow.  "We will support you so that you discharge God's will and to bring transformation in this church," said Linturi.  Kiraitu noted that the AIPCA was among the first churches in the country and was part of the struggle for freedom.     By Stephanie Wangari | 4 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 5 hours ago By Amos Kareithi | 6 hours ago By Dennis Kabaara | 8 hours ago
