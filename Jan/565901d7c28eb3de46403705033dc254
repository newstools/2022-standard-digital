Newly-posted Central Regional Coordinator Esther Maina. [Boniface Gikandi, Standard]  Human rights activists against gender-based violence in Central Kenya have welcomed Regional Commissioner Esther Wamuyu Maina to the region.  Ms Maina takes over from Wilfred Nyangw’anga in changes announced earlier in the week following the resignation of former Rift Valley RC George Natembeya.  Yesterday, Centre for Community Empowerment Director Jane Kamwaga said the posting of a woman Regional Commissioner gives women hope in tackling social injustices.  "The new RC will have to deal with brewing of illicit liquor and rising cases of gender-based violence," she said. Kamwanga applauded the government for posting a courageous female administrator who will team up with other leaders.  “Being an electioneering year, the administrator should work towards protecting female aspirants from bullying among other threats during the campaigns," she said.  Kamwaga observed that Maina will understand women folk better and help promote gender balance.  A Kirinyaga based church leader Samuel Kimata said the return of cheap liquor in parts of Murang’a, Kirinyaga and Kiambu counties, had turned hundreds of youth into zombies.  He said mental health issues require a different approach following alarming incidents of suicide.  “We have a mother figure who will require support to implement programmes initiated by national and county governments,” said Kimata.  Maina comes from Western region to replace Mr Nyang’wanga who was moved to the Office of the President.  Maina, a former County Commissioner who served in Embu, Kiambu and Machakos counties before she was promoted to the rank of RC is passionate about youth and women programmes.  She has been a crusader in the fight against fighting sexual offences, illicit brews and FGM.
