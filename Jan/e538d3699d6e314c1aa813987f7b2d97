The main entrance to Homa Bay court where the couple was charged for failing to take a minor to school. [James Omoro, Standard]  A couple in Homa Bay county has been arrested and charged for allegedly not taking their nine-year-old to school  Humphrey Muturi, the headteacher of Kuja Primary School and his wife Catherine Gati who is also a teacher are accused of using the girl as a house help to take care of their baby instead of letting her go to school.  The two were arraigned at the Homa Bay Courts and charged with economic exploitation of a child contrary to the Children’s Act number eight of 2001.  The court heard that on diverse dates from May 2021 to January 11, 2022, Muturi and Gati also engaged the minor in house chores in Rodi Township against the law. They reportedly interfered with the child's right to education by engaging her in babysitting during school days.  The court further heard that the said minor dropped out of school in class two in May last year when her biological parents from Migori County handed her over to the couple as a house help.  The neighbours of the couple however got concerned and reported the matter to Homa Bay Sub-County Children's Officer Joseph Otieno.  Otieno and other officers raided the couple’s house before they were arrested.    The couple denied the charges against them.  They were granted a cash bail of Sh20,00 or Sh50,000 bond and a surety of the same amount by Principal Magistrate Ruth Maloba.  The case has been scheduled for pretrial on January 31.  The minor has been rescued and is being protected in a children's home.  By Stanley Ongwae | 1 day ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By Harold Odhiambo | 2 days ago
