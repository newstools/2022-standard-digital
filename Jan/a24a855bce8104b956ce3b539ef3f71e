Amani National Congress (ANC) has downplayed Friday's defection by some of its key politicians.  The party's branch secretary Amukoa Anangwe and youth leader Emmanuel Buchichi said Lugari MP Ayub Savula and Teso South's Oku Kaunya, who defected during Bukhung ll rally, were free to support ODM leader Raila Odinga’s presidential bid.  Mr Savula and Mr Kaunya led several ward representatives from the county in switching their support to Azimio La Umoja and Raila’s presidential quest.  Prof Anangwe said the defectors now cannot call themselves ANC members. "For instance, Savula was categorical that he does not want anything to do with OKA and that he fully supports Azimio La Umoja and Raila. He cannot therefore claim to be in ANC, which is an affiliate of OKA," said Anangwe.  The ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi’s presidential campaigns manager added: “It's that season politicians hop from one party to another. Even ODM has witnessed defections. Governors Amason Kingi, Josphat Nanok and some MPs from the Coast, including Aisha Jumwa, decamped from ODM".     By Stephen Rutto | 1 hour ago By Nathan Ochunge | 2 hours ago By Philip Mwakio and RENSON MNYAMWEZI | 5 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo and John Shilitsa | 5 hours ago List of high-end properties that former Attorney-General Charles Njonjo owned
