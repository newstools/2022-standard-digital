James Ng'ang'a at Thika Level 5 Hospital yesterday. [Fidelis Kabunyi]  A young man is fighting for his life at Thika Level V Hospital in Kiambu County after he fell off a matatu along Thika Road.  James Ng’ang’a, 22, had boarded the matatu belonging Lopha Travellers Sacco in Nairobi on Thursday last week around 9.20pm and was to disembark at the Githurai 45 stage.  However, the matatu driver didn’t stop at the stage. The interior designer said from his hospital bed that the matatu stopped in the middle of the road at Kahawa Sukari and the conductor asked passengers to alight.  When it was his turn to disembark, the matatu sped off suddenly, throwing Mr Ng’ang’a onto the tarmac. It ran over him, fracturing his left leg and injuring his left hand. Kahawa Sukari Base Commander Hondo Chacha said driver Peter Karanja and conductor Rochester Musyoka were arrested and released on Sh10,000 cash bail.  “We arrested the duo and the case was recorded on Monday. Our officers will visit the victim and fill a P3 form which after which we shall re-arrest the suspects and charge them with three offences, including dangerous driving,” said Chacha.  The vehicle was also released after inspection. Nganga’s brother Onesmus Karanja called for speedy investigations into the incident.   By Boniface Gikandi | 1 day ago By Kamore Maina | 2 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 2 days ago By James Munyeki | 2 days ago
