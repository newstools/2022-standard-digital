The suspect allegedly stole the funds on diverse dates between December 19, 2019 and September 30, 2021. [Courtesy]  The former general manager of a distribution company based in Kisii County was on Wednesday, January 26 arraigned at the Makadara Law Courts in Nairobi for allegedly stealing Sh78 million from her ex-employer.  The court was told that Millicent Akeyo Akinyi allegedly stole the funds on diverse dates between December 19, 2019 and September 30, 2021.  Akinyi is alleged to have, thereafter, resigned from the company.  “Being a servant of TB Distributors Limited, you stole Sh78,014,894, which came into your possession by virtue of employment as the general manager of the distribution company,” the charge sheet said. After the said-theft was discovered, the firm launched investigations, which resulted in the arraignment of Akinyi, warehouse lead officer, finance chief and sales representatives.  The company said in court that neither Akinyi nor her co-accused alerted the directors about the loss of funds.  The directors told the court that they turned to auditors to help unravel the mystery of missing funds.  Upon completion of the audit, which revealed that Sh78 million was missing from the company accounts, the directors filed a report at Kamukunji Police Station in Nairobi.  Akinyi was, consequently, arrested at her new work centre in Makaburini area, Kamukunji Constituency.  Akinyi denied the charges, and was released on Sh10 million bond. The matter resumes for hearing on July 11, 2022.  By Josphat Thiongó | 53 minutes ago By Mate Tongola | 2 hours ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 20 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 20 hours ago
