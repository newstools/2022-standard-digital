Corporal Joseph Kamau Muthunga at the Naivasha law courts where he was deemed fit to stand trial for murdering his boss sergeant Ayub Polo in Kedong ranch in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha on Christmas Day. [Antony Gitonga, Standard]  A police officer accused of shooting dead his senior at Kedong Ranch in Naivasha, Nakuru County, on Christmas Day is fit to stand trial, the court has been told.  A psychiatric report from the Gilgil Sub-county hospital has consequently given the police the go-ahead to charge Corporal Joseph Kamau Muthunga with the murder.  The 39-year-old is accused of murdering Sergeant Ayub Polo by shooting him at Kedong Ranch AP camp on December 25.  A medical report from consultant psychiatrist S.W. Karanja showed the accused was fit to take a plea as he was aware of the charges facing him. Dr Karanja said the accused person even admitted to shooting his senior after an altercation although he wasn’t aware the victim died.  Naivasha Chief Magistrate, Nathan Shiundu, closed a miscellaneous application allowing police to hold Kamau for eight days, and directed that he be charged with murder before the High Court on Friday.  A post-mortem conducted on the body last week established the officer was shot three times and died from excessive bleeding.     By Christopher Kipsang | 8 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 8 hours ago By Caroline Chebet | 8 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 8 hours ago Chief of staff: Why public and private offices opt for the post
