ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his FORD-Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangula during a rally at the Nakuru ASK Showground. [Courtesy]  Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi says his former One Kenya Alliance (OKA) co-principals demanded that he gives them his NDC guest list before the convention.  Mudavadi accuses Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper and Gideon Moi of KANU of attempting to control ANC’s Annual Delegates Conference (NDC) VIP attendance register.  ANC held its NDC at the Bomas of Kenya on Sunday, January 23, when Mudavadi announced that he was joining hands with Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA Party.  Musyoka and Gideon walked out of Bomas minutes after UDA-allied leaders arrived at the venue. Addressing a rally at the Nakuru ASK Showground on Wednesday, January 26 – the first one alongside Ruto after their Sunday pact –  Mudavadi said he did not influence the guest lists when both Musyoka and Gideon held their NDCs recently.  “KANU invited Raila Odinga as chief guest during their NDC [on September 30, 2021], Wiper Party invited Raila Odinga to their NDC [on November 25, 2021]. I did not ask them to add or omit the names of certain people, because they had a right to choose who attends their functions. However, when it was my turn, they wanted to decide who comes to my event,” Mudavadi said.  “They’d asked me to share my guest list with them a day to the function. They even threatened that they’d skip the event if certain people were invited,” Mudavadi said.  Both Gideon and Kalonzo are on the record saying that Mudavadi never informed them that Ruto was going to attend the function.  The duo accused Mudavadi of betraying OKA’s cause.
