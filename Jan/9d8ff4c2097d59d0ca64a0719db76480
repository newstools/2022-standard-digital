The 31-year-old primary school teacher allegedly authored fake death news. [Courtesy]  A 31-year-old male teacher risks a long jail term for allegedly authoring a Facebook post claiming that Nancy Macharia, the Teachers Service Commission CEO, had died.   A tweet by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) indicated that Jeremiah Mwawuganga Samuel allegedly authored a Facebook post using a fake account purporting to be that of the Teachers Service Commission, alleging that Macharia’s body was found in another education stakeholder’s bed.  “The primary school teacher was arrested on Saturday, January 23, at Makutano Shopping Centre, Makueni County,” DCI’s Sunday morning tweet revealed.  A screenshot of the alleged post shared on the investigator’s micro-blogging platform indicated that the post was made by an account called Jeremiah Sammy Mwawuganga, to a pseudo group named ‘teacher service commission’. “Breaking News, Nancy Macharia is dead. Her body has been found in Oyuu’s body,” the post read in part.  The sleuths say the post prompted an extensive forensic analysis to identify the suspect, who was found in possession of the handset used in creating the viral post.  Detectives have also confirmed that the Facebook account used to create the post was owned by the suspect.  The suspect is currently being held at the DCI Headquarters ahead of his arraignment on Monday, January 24 morning.
