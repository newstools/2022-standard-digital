[Maarufu Mohamed, Standard]  Religious leaders have asked Mombasa County to pay doctors their November and December salary arrears to avert a strike planned to begin tomorrow.  Speaking in Mombasa, Majlis Ulama said the doctors were within the confines of the law to issue a strike notice to the county administration and it was upon the employer to address their grievances.  Led by Sheikh Abu Hamza, the clerics, blamed the devolved government for putting to risk the lives of residents, who depend on public hospitals for medical services.  “They care less because when they are sick, they are flown to South Africa, Germany and the United States of America while the majority of our residents suffer,” he said.   The clerics called on Governor Hassan Joho to implement all outstanding labour issues raised by the disgruntled doctors and other health workers to avert industrial action that would ground health services.  “They should pay their two-month salary arrears, address promotions issues and provide them with compressive NHIF insurance cover. All these should be done without delay,” added Sheikh Abu Hamza.  The religious leaders argued that it was unfair for doctors and other health workers to stay for two months without salaries during the Covid-19 pandemic.    “The same county government that purports to have no money to pay doctors, spent millions of shillings to hire musicians to perform during New Year day party at the Mama Ngina Waterfront Park,” said Sheikh Abu Hamza.  Coast KMPDU Chairperson Hassan Ahmed said the county government has been unable to address their grievances.
