Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi. [Mose Sammy, Standard]  Efforts to rebuild houses for families whose homes were torched by suspected bandits in Ol-Moran area of Laikipia County a few months ago are now in top gear.  First to receive the government-sponsored programme are families from Kisii Ndogo village, which was the most affected.  The County Government of Laikipia in collaboration with the national government is working to resettle over 100 families.  The programme has also been extended to setting up a police command division headquarters in Ol-Moran trading centre and staff houses at Survey shopping centres.   Yesterday, Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi, who toured the area, said the programme will be completed in the next three months.  “We want to make sure all those displaced by the violence return to their homes as soon as possible. Never again do we want to experience such chaos that left our people dead,” he said.  He noted that the move to set up a police station was crucial in order to accommodate more police officers in the region.  “The national government has promised to post more police officers, especially along the Baringo border. That is why we found it wise to set up a police station that will accommodate more officers. We will also build housing for them,” noted Muriithi.  He called on security personnel to make sure all armed herders moved out of the area.  During the height of the violence that left 17 dead, many sought refuge at Ol-Moran trading centre, while others fled to Sipili and Rumuruti.  The beneficiaries have lauded the program saying it will help them resettle and resume their normal lives, noting they not only lost property, but also crops and hence are glaring at looming hunger.
