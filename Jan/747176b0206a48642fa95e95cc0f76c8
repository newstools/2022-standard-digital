Laikipia governor Ndiritu Muriithi during the interview at his offices in Nanyuki town, December 20, 2021. [Mose Sammy, Standard]  Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has acknowledged his appointment as the chairman of Raila Odinga campaigns board.  Muriithi said the appointment will not deter him from defending his seat on a PNU ticket.   The governor said his support for Raila Odinga should not be misinterpreted to mean that he had joined ODM, but, observed that the former prime minister will be seeking presidency as a coalition partner.  “I’m honoured that they have picked me as chairman of the campaign team. Raila is a visionary leader who I will support. But, I will be vying on a PNU ticket,” he said. He spoke at Nyahururu town where he called on Kenyans to rally their support for the ODM party Leader and seek peace and unity ahead of the coming polls.    The first-time governor, who won his Laikipia Governor seat as an independent candidate, is expected to bring enormous experience into Odinga’s campaign planning from the private sector.  He is currently the Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs Committee chairperson of the Council of Governors.
