Gavel on desk [Courtesy]  A man suspected to have killed his wife on Monday in Kisii will remain in police custody for 14 days as investigations continue.   Lucas Bosire, 40, appeared before Kisii Senior Resident Magistrate Paul Mutai yesterday. He is accused of committing the offence at Bosike in Bonchari on the night of January 10.  Bosire is alleged to have hit Everline Kerubo, 36, with a blunt object on the head as she took a shower in a bathroom at night. The woman, who is said to have been pregnant, collapsed and died. Bosire is said to have later disappeared from the scene.  “This court has decided that since the allegations against the accused person are serious given they involve murder, his security and that of witnesses cannot be guaranteed if he is released on bond. He will be held for 14 days pending investigations,” said the magistrate. Vincent Maloba, an investigations officer at Gesonso Police Station, had made a successful application to the court to have the suspect held for 14 days pending conclusion of investigations.  The magistrate said the case will come up before the court on January 27 for further directions. Bosire survived death narrowly after an angry public baying nearly lynched him after he was arrested before being taken to Igonga Police post.
