[File, Standard]  The National Police Service says it has heightened security surveillance countrywide after the Dutch, German and French embassies in Kenya issued terror alerts on Thursday, January 27.  Police spokesperson Bruno Shioso, in a press statement dated Friday, January 28, said it had received information about the terror alerts.  “Our attention has been drawn to information circulating on social media warning of impending terror attack, particularly in Nairobi,” he said.  To avert the said attacks, which the embassies said would be concentrated in Nairobi, North Eastern and Coast, Shioso said the Police Service has re-engineered its units in line with modern-day policing dynamics. “We urge the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities through our toll-free numbers: 999, 911, 112 and 0800722203,” said Shioso, assuring Kenyans that security has been enhanced in the wake of attack warnings.   The German, French, Dutch and the UK embassies in Kenya last night warned their citizens against planned terror attacks in Nairobi, North Eastern and the Kenyan Coast.
