[Collins Oduor, Standard]  A gold miner who was trapped at Kapuodho goldmine in North Kamagambo ward in Rongo Sub-County, Migori County for four days has been rescued.  The gold miner, who was identified as Noah Ogweno, was on Thursday at noon trapped at the gold mine after the walls of the mine he was working in collapsed.    Efforts to rescue him kicked off immediately with several leaders from the county channelling their help towards the mission. According to Rongo MP Paul Abuor, their rescue team managed to get the miner out of the collapsed goldmine alive.  The MP noted that it has been a tense 72 hours of operation and prayers that made the rescue mission a success.  “We thank the excavator operators and other rescuers, who worked day and night. I also wish to thank all those who offered us support throughout this operation to save Noah’s life,” Mr Abuor said.  Ogweno was rushed to Tabaka Mission Hospital in Kisii County.  Migori Governor Okoth Obado noted that they swiftly moved into action to save the gold miner after receiving the information that he was trapped in the gold mines.  “We prayed that our equipment gets access to the main tunnel where he was trapped. We were very optimistic and upbeat that we could find him alive because he was communicating to us,” Mr Obado said.   By Caleb Kingwara | 16 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo | 17 hours ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By Edwin Nyarangi | 2 days ago
