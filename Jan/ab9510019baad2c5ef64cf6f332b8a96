Mwea East Sub-County Police Commander Daniel Kitavi [File]  Inmates are suspected to have set fire to a section of cells at Mwea GK Prison.  Mwea East Sub-County Police Commander Daniel Kitavi said the fire is suspected to have been started by some inmates who had been transferred from Kamiti Maximum Prison.  “When they arrived, some of them even refused to get out of the bus. And when they did, some refused to register and those are the ones who are violent and causing all these troubles,” said a source at the prison who sought anonymity.  The source said that 10 out of the 58 inmates had accepted to register and receive their cards while the rest cased mayhem during the exercise on Saturday morning.  It is alleged that some of the inmates declined to eat and they threw human waste in protest.     By Brian Otieno and Judah Ben-Hur | 3 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 8 hours ago By James Munyeki | 9 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 9 hours ago How Merali schooled teachers with crafty Spire Bank deal
