The suspect's son, Bedan Irungu, succumbed to stomach injuries. [Courtesy]  Police have launched a manhunt for 21-year-old Nancy Munjiru who is alleged to have stabbed her two children at Kianderi village in Kiharu sub-county, Murangá on Saturday, January 8.  Her son, Bedan Irungu, succumbed to stomach injuries while Benson Munjiru, 4, survived the ordeal and is undergoing treatment at Murang’a Level Four Hospital.  Munjiru’s brother, Benson Kiarie, says his nephew told to him that their mother stabbed them and fled.  He added that he entered their room after he heard Benson crying and upon entering found Irungu's lifeless body on the floor. The two boys lived with their grandmother. “I could not trace their mother and had to look for assistance to take the injured child to hospital,” said Kiarie.  Murang’a County Police Commander Donatha Kiplangat said the suspect was being pursued by the police.  “There is need for people to open up should they have problems in life rather than attempting solve issues by committing offences which are punishable by law,” said Ms Kiplangat.  And in the same County, a father who murdered his form one daughter at Gathuri village in Murang’a South after finding her flirting with an age mate has been arrested.  The suspect who is being held at the Saba Saba Police Station is reported to have bumped into his daughter fooling around with the boy when she was supposed to be in school.  The man is alleged to have beaten her to death before dumping her body in a culvert on the Kenol-Murang'a highway.  “On Saturday, he removed the body and placed it at the edge of the road where the locals spotted it and reported to police who picked up the suspect," said Kiplangat while calling on wananchi to volunteer information.
