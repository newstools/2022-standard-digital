A semi-automatic handgun. [Courtesy]  Two businessmen were on Wednesday charged before a Nairobi court with stealing a firearm, a Ceska pistol.   Wosken Ndombi Makokha and Joseph Ochieng, arrested in Nairobi on Thursday last week, also face two other counts of handling stolen property and being in possession of ammunition illegally.  The two, who appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi, are said to have committed the offenses on November 6, 2020, in Industrial Area jointly with others, not before the court.  The pistol, according to the charge sheet, belonged to the late Tapata Lengues and is valued at Sh200,000. The duo faced another charge of making a document without lawful authority contrary to section 357(a) of the penal code.  The charge sheet stated that on or before November 21, 2019, at an unknown place within the country, jointly with others before the court and with intent to deceive, made a firearm certificate claiming it had been issued to Makokha, the first accused person. The certificate was allegedly from the Firearms Licensing Board.  Makokha faced a separate count which stated that on January 11 this year at Gikomba, in Nairobi, he was found in possession of a Ceska pistol without a valid firearm certificate.  Makokha again was charged that on the same day and the same place, he was found in possession of 49 rounds of ammunition of calibre 9mm without a valid firearm certificate.  The suspects denied all the charges and were released on a bond of Sh500,000 each or alternatively pay a cash bail of Sh300,000 with a provision of one contact person.  The case will be mentioned on February 1.   By Collins Kweyu | 2 hours ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 6 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 15 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 15 hours ago
