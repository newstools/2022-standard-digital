Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) gantry cranes offload containers from a Transhipment Cargo Vessel at the port of Lamu in Lamu County on Saturday, September 18, 2021. [Maarufu Mohamed, Standard]  The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has bought three ship-to-shore gantry cranes from Japan at a cost of Sh3.3 billion.   KPA officials said the acquisition was in line with the port operator's modernisation and expansion programme as outlined in its 2005 master plan.  Speaking at the quayside after receiving the equipment yesterday, the acting General Manager for Engineering Services, Javan Wanga, said the ship carrying the equipment left Japan on December 18.  "This acquisition comes at a time of great economic recovery. We look at improved productivity with this additional equipment," Wanga said.   The ship-to-shore gantry cranes have a capacity to handle 60 tonnes each, and make 40 moves per hour.   KPA Principal Corporate Communications Officer Haji Masemo said the port masterplan aims to expand berths and acquire new cargo handling equipment.  Phase one of the project was completed and operations started in April 2016. Phase II of the second container terminal is nearing completion.
