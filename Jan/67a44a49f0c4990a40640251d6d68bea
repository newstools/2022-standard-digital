Nicholas Bundi when he started his 300km trek to Nairobi yesterday. [Phares Mutembei, Standard]  A brother of missing security consultant Mwenda Mbijjiwe has embarked on a 300-kilometre walk to put pressure on authorities to give the family answers.  Nicholas Bundi (pictured) is trekking from Meru to Nairobi, where he hopes to present a petition to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti, requesting information on his missing sibling.  Mr Mbijjiwe went missing on June 12, last year, as he drove to Meru from Nairobi. The hired car he was using was found abandoned in Kiambu County. Efforts to trace the 45-year-old man have hit a dead end.  His distraught mother Jane Gatwiri and other family members made numerous trips to police stations in Nairobi, seeking to find him. Yesterday, Bundi set off from Meru town at 3am armed with a placard and a Bible. He aims to highlight the pain his family and the local community is going through as the former Kenya Air Force man remains missing.    Bundi said the Bible will give him the encouragement to soldier on, noting that Mbijjiwe must be found, dead or alive.  He is pleading for information that could help find the brother.  Bundi said he intends to camp at the DCI headquarters until Kinoti gives him audience and answers on the search for Mbijjiwe.  “We have travelled to Nairobi so many times and visited various police stations and offices, but they have been taking us in circles,” he said.  The mother appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene.  “Our hearts are very weak and it is only prayers and hope that have kept us going. The government should tell us where my son is. In case he has done something wrong and is alive, he should be charged in court,” she said.
