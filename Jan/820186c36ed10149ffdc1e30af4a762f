IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati speaking to the press after meeting with IEBC officials to discuss peaceful elections 2022. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and political parties have been urged to disqualify aspirants who cause chaos during campaigns.  Elders in Suba North Constituency, led by Luo Council of Elders chair in Suba North Daniel Oketch, and deputy Ouma Otondo, said stern measures would avert poll violence by instilling discipline among errant politicians.  “The IEBC should issue and implement rules that bar politicians from contesting seats they are eyeing if it is established that they are responsible for causing violence during campaigns. This is the only action that can discipline those who are errant,” Oketch said.  Otondo said: “Political parties can also tame their members who cause violence. My appeal goes to ODM which is the dominant party in this region also to disqualify their members who cause violence in the name of contesting elective positions." Speaking at Lwanda Nyamasare trading center, the elders said campaigns should be undertaken peacefully. The elders also urged National Cohesion and Integration Commission to monitor politicians.
