The student claims he was trying to mask a bad smell and get rid of insects. [Courtesy]  A parent of a form three student who was kicked out of a national school for having a matchbox and incense in class has sued the institution claiming the teacher misunderstood his son's intent and did not give him a fair hearing.  In his case against Nairobi School, the teen’s father codenamed MJM, says his son was in November last year suspended indefinitely for burning incense in class without the school listening to his side of story.  The student codenamed MWM claims he was trying to mask a bad smell and get rid of insects which was a common occurrence in the school and that the teacher and the school board took excessive action against him without giving him a fair hearing.  Court papers read that the minor apologized and promised to be in good books but his plea fell on deaf ears. “In out-rightly and indefinitely suspending the Minor without affording him the opportunity to be heard, the respondents abused their power,” the case filed before the High Court in Nairobi reads in part.  Court record reads that MWM was suspended on December 15.  This followed a letter issued to him on December 1 which required him to bring his parent to school seven days later for a disciplinary hearing.  “The minor expressed remorse for his conduct and intimated his willingness to reform and put more effort in his school studies but the housemaster would hear none of it,” the court papers continue.  The parent who has also sued Attorney General and the school’s board wants the court to force the school’s management to re-admit MWM.
