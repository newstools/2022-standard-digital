The programme will be funded by the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF). [Caleb Kingwara, Standard]  At least 500 vulnerable people in Suna West constituency, Migori County, are set to benefit from free National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) cover.  The programme will be funded by the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) to the tune of Sh3 million, money that has already been provided for in the current budget.  Provision of free NHIF cover to the vulnerable, who include the elderly, is part of efforts to support the universal health coverage project by the Jubilee administration.  "This programme is part of national government efforts to ensure every Kenyan has access to affordable and quality healthcare," said area MP Peter Masara who said the money will pay their NHIF cover for the 500 people at least for one year. "In two weeks’ time we will allocate another Sh 2.4 million for another 400 beneficiaries,” said Masara.  He added: "I believe if we continue working with the national government, at least 3,700 vulnerable individuals who have been identified in this constituency will benefit from the NHIF programme."  Ms Maria Lekonoto, the area NG-CDF board director, said their efforts are targeting the vulnerable, who include the elderly and widows who have no source of income.   "We encourage partnerships to ensure that universal health coverage, one of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s main agenda, is realized. It is the right of every citizen to enjoy good health services,” said Ms Lekeloto.  Migori County NHIF branch manager Mark Chepkiyeng thanked the Suna West CDF board for setting aside money to take care of the health of the vulnerable.    By Stephen Nzioka | 9 hours ago By James Omoro | 11 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 12 hours ago By Benard Sanga | 13 hours ago
