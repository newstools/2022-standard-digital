Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero says corruption cases against him are politically instigated.  Kidero served as the Nairobi Governor between 2013 and 2017.  In an exclusive interview on KTN News and while distancing himself from commenting on the cases, Kidero reiterated his innocence until proven guilty.  “I have been accused of corruption and prosecuted in court. All these cases are politically influenced and I will give my thesis on that once the case is determined,” Kidero said.  The pioneer Governor of Nairobi is now eyeing the Governorship of Homa Bay County, his rural home. “Chapter six of the constitution has been reduced to one crime of corruption. It has so many other things because our cases are alleged meaning they are not proven. EACC should not try us in the court of public opinion let them be proven in court,” he added.  Kidero has also alleged that he decided to run for Homa Bay Governorship on an independent ticket because he was not included in the ODM party consensus.  “I was never invited for ODM aspirants meeting. I was told when the meeting was underway and before I could finish I got the announcement. That is when I decided to talk to the people of Homa Bay and they are happy with my candidature,” he claimed.  Kidero was arraigned in 2019 alongside 16 others.
