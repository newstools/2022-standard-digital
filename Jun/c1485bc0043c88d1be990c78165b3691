A court has granted detectives more days to detain a man who has been masquerading as a lawyer.  Duncan Kahiro will remain in police cells for another 14 days after Kiambu Chief Magistrate Emily Ominde granted Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) detectives their request.  Ominde allowed the detectives to hold the suspect for more days to continue with their investigations. The Law Society of Kenya is expected to provide information on the suspect.      The court had on May 26 directed Kahiro to deposit Sh100,000 cash bail pending investigations.  Today, the investigating officer Peter Kingawi made an application urging the court to grant detectives 14 days saying he needed time to file a report from LSK.  "The LSK is set to give a comprehensive report on the matter within 14 days. We are requesting the suspects to cooperate with investigations as we seek to file the LSK report," Kingawi said.   The prosecution had asked the court to remand Kahiro for 10 days to allow them complete investigations.  In an affidavit, Kingawi told the court that Kahiro has been on police radar since June 2021 following numerous complaints by victims who are alleged to have paid Kahiro to represent them on various matters.  "I urge the court to consider the offences as serious since more witnesses are set to record their statements," Kingawi told the court.
