A man in Kiegoi village in Igembe South, Meru County, is talk on social media after he sat on the landing skids of CS Peter Munya’s helicopter as it took off.  The incident occurred on Wednesday evening during the Agriculture CS' tour of Meru County, where he announced a national waiver of charges for the export of miraa.  “I have waved all charges on licences for purposes of exporting Miraa at the national level,” said CS Munya.  In a video making rounds, the man, whose identity is yet to be revealed, was captured seated with one of his feet hanging out from the skids as the helicopter hovered slightly above the ground before making its way back to the landing area.  At some point, he is seen waving at a crowd that had gathered to cheer him on. It was, however, not all fun and games. Armed security officers pounced on him soon after he jumped off and attempted to flee.  It is not clear whether he was arrested as the police are yet to pronounce themselves on the issue.  Incidents of locals hanging on helicopters continue to be witnessed in various parts of the country.  In March this year, a man hang onto the skids of a helicopter that had taken off shortly after the burial of former Mount Elgon MP, John Serut, in Bungoma County.  The incident prompted the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) to issue a warning to helicopter operators against endangering the lives of helicopter crews and locals at landing zones.  In a communication to helicopter managers and operators, KCAA Director-General Gilbert Kibe gave direction on the requirements of the aircraft as well as the suitability of the landing zones.  Kibe said that it was the responsibility of the operators and pilots to land and take off at least three kilometres from the activity venue, and to ensure at least a 30-metre radius from where people are.
