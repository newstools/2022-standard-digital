A man charged with killing his wife has pleaded not guilty at the High Court in Eldoret.  Appearing before Justice Eric Ogola, Mr Khadir Manda pleaded not guilty to the charges read to him.  Before the charges were read to Khadir Manda, Justice Eric Ogola had inquired whether the accused’s family was in court but none was present.  Justice Ogola directed that the accused be held at the Eldoret GK Prison as the probation officers work on a report that will determine whether he will be granted bond or not.  The court had on Tuesday received a mental assessment report of the suspect from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), Eldoret, which revealed that Manda is mentally fit to stand trial. Deputy Registrar Rosemary Onkoba had then directed Manda be arraigned before Justice Ogola to take plea.Manda, a casual labourer, was arrested by the police on May 6, 2022, after he was linked to the brutal killing of his wife in Iten town, Elgeyo Marakwet County.Monica Komen’s body was found in a pool of blood in her rented house on the outskirts of the town after which the police arrested her husband as prime suspect in the killing.The police officers, led by Keiyo North Sub County Police Commander Tom Makori, who visited the scene found the body of the 38-year-old mother of three children in their house with a stab wound on the left side of the ribs.Detectives recovered a kitchen knife suspected to have been used by the killer at the crime scene, which will be used as an exhibit during the trial of the murder case.  The court will issue further directions on bond and start of the trial case against the accused on July 21.
