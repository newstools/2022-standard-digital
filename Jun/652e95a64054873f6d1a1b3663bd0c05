Edward Mwachinga, a Kenya Kwanza task force member and Chairperson of the Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) party National Elections Board (NEB), has died.  According to his family, Mwachinga died on Tuesday, June 14 at his home in Nairobi after a long illness.  PAA party leader Amason Kingi condoled with his family, saying they had lost a hard worker.     “It goes without saying that as a county, and as a party, we have indeed lost a strong-willed scholar who gave everything when it came to empowering the lives of the Coastal people,” Kingi tweeted.  The tax lawyer had recently been appointed member of the Kenya Kwanza National Economic task force by Deputy President William Ruto.  Until his demise, Mwachinga was a partner with Viva Africa Consulting.  Trained in international business, trade and tax law, Mwachinga set out as a tax advisor with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2001.  He later took up a managerial position with the Deloitte firm in Tanzania in 2004.  He held a Bachelor of Law Degree from the University of Nairobi (UoN) and a Master of Law Degree from the University of London.
