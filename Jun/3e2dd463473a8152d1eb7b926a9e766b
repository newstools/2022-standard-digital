United Democratic Alliance (UDA) governor candidate in Elgeyo Marakwet Wesley Rotich and his running mate Grace Cheserek have been cleared to run in the August 9 polls.  Their joint ticket had run into headwinds when two applicants filed a case challenging Prof Cheserek's eligibility.  Gabriel Kimeli Biwott and Ian Kiprop Orogony, who are voters in the area, had complained to the Disputes Resolution Committee of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) that Cheserek did not resign from her government job within the stipulated time.  However, during the tribunal's hearing at the Milimani court, it emerged that the two had withdrawn their case paving the way for IEBC to clear Korir, who is the current deputy governor, alongside his running mate.   Mr Titus Tiego, the chairman of the disputes committee, said the two are free to continue with their campaigns and participate in the elections. "You are free to move on with your campaigns as you seek election for the governorship of ElgeyoMarakwet County. I wish you all the best," said Tiego.  Speaking to the press outside Milimani law court flanked by their lawyer Ham Lagat, the two said that they had met all the requirements of the IEBC within time.  "We submitted  our registration letters and papers within the stipulated period and after the two complaints realised that they had no other way but to withdraw their complaint," said Rotich   Yesterday was a beehive of activities as the three tribunals panel will be making rulings on the validity of participation of Presidential aspirants, Walter Mong'are, Reuben Kigame and Ekuro Aukot.  Other judgements were for governorship aspirants Mike Sonko (Mombasa) and Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) among a host of aspirants for various seats.
