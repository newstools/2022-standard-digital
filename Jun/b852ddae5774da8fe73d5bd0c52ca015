Police are looking for members of a gang that has been giving residents sleepless nights through attacks and robberies.  On Monday night, the gang is said to have raided a home in Kakrao Ward, Suna East sub-County, raped a woman, and stolen property of unknown value.  The victim's husband said the robbers gained access to their house around midnight through a window. The man, who is physically challenged, said the thieves told him they had been sent to kill him.  "The robbers, who were armed, demanded Sh1 million. They collected our phones, TV, radio, gas cylinder, money, and many other properties, which they loaded into the vehicle they were using. All this time, they had tied my hands with ropes. They also tortured my wife and daughter," he said after the attack that lasted over three hours.  He said his wife has not been able to speak after being tortured and raped. "My wife is too traumatised. She was left in so much pain. She was taken for counselling. We have reported the matter to the police."  Residents have raised concerns about increasing insecurity in the area and called on the police to intensify patrols.  Mr Nicholas Odhiambo, a resident of Mufulu village, said, "The criminals break into houses and steal. They also waylay residents on the roads and rob them. It is a serious matter."  Another resident, Benter Achieng', said robbers broke into her house two weeks ago and stole Sh100,000, clothes, duvets, a TV, and a computer.  County police commander Mark Wanjala said they have launched investigations into the incidences. “We are asking residents to work with the police and alert us whenever they see suspicious people around them,” Mr Wanjala said.
