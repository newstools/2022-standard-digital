Chief Justice Martha Koome says the Judiciary is adequately prepared to handle all manner of election-related petitions.  Speaking at a National Cohesion and Integration and Commission (NCIC) function in Nairobi on Wednesday, June 15, Koome said more magistrate’s courts have been installed to help resolve disputes related to election complaints.  The chief justice also said the courts are prioritising the hearing and determination of hate speech-related cases.  “When a case is about hate speech, that file is handled expeditiously,” she said.  “I urge all political actors to put the national interests above personal interests. Don’t polarise Kenyans along ethnic lines,” added the CJ. The NCIC said six counties are likely to experience higher levels of post-poll chaos. The six are Nairobi, Nakuru, Kericho, Kisumu, Uasin Gishu and Mombasa.  Some ten counties have been classified as mid-level violence hotspot areas. They are Narok, Marsabit, Laikipia, Lamu, Baringo, Isiolo, Meru, Nandi, Samburu and Bomet.
