He became a household name at the height of the Building Bridges Initiative appeal, dismantling the quest to change the Constitution with relative ease.  The one hour he spent presenting his submissions before the seven-judge bench turned him into an overnight celebrity, attracting praise and ridicule in equal measure.   Mr Isaac Aluochier, an activist who presented a strong case against BBI at the apex court, now hopes to transform that fame into votes.  He has set his eyes on the Kamagambo MCA seat in Migori County.  The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) yesterday cleared Mr Aluochier to contest the ward representative seat after meeting all the requirements. He is running on a Justice and Freedom party ticket. Moments after he was cleared to run, Mr Aluochier who describes himself as an arbitrator, said he has entered the race to serve the people.  He had first expressed interest in running for Migori governor before shifting to the Senate seat and now the MCA post.  In 2017, he also made a failed attempt for the Rongo parliamentary seat as an independent candidate but lost to ODM’s Paul Abuor.  Mr Aluochier was one of the petitioners against the BBI and came into the limelight following his eloquent presentation during the court sessions.  He told The Standard that he has been human rights and constitutional activist for a decade, arguing that his experience has given him the knowledge to represent the people effectively.   By Anne Atieno | 2 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 15 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By Stanley Ongwae | 2 days ago
