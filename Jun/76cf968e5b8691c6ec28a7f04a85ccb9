Police enforcing an auction have stumbled upon guns and ammunition in an office in Nairobi’s Kilimani area on Tuesday.   In a police report seen by The Standard, officers escorted auctioneers from Ballon Wanjala Nangalama T/A to break into an office along Wood Avenue in Kilimani belonging to a man identified as Ken Lugwili.  Lungwili is said to have accrued a Sh4.9 million debt in rent.     According to an OB report filed at the Kilimani Police Station, the auctioneers arrived at the building to seize goods and property belonging to the tenant of Vic Technologies Limited. Police then discovered a standard armoury and seized 22 assorted firearms, over 500 rounds of ammunition, and sniper torches.  “Officers discovered among other items; nine Escort magnum short guns, one Benelli short gun, five guatro short guns, one savage short gun, six pistols with two magazines, ten sniper torches, nine double magazine carriers, and 25 pistol holsters,” police said.  Kilimani DCI boss Stephen Tanki confirmed to The Standard that the firearms have been escorted to the station where other specialized units from ballistics, photography and the Anti-Terror Police Unit are expected to countercheck the exhibits.  Preliminary investigations indicate that the tenant is a licensed firearm dealer.
