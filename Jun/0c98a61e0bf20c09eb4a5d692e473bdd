Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has called a meeting of Ukambani leaders to chart the community’s political direction.  The Friday meeting comes a day before Mr Musyoka presents his presidential nomination papers to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).  The Wiper leader faces the options of going ahead with his ambition to vie for the top seat or going back to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition.    “Our party leader wants to meet with leaders from Lower Eastern so that every decision he makes, moving forward, carries the aspirations of the entire region. That is why he has invited most Wiper leaders to his Yatta home,” said Mr Musyoka’s aide. Two weeks ago, a leaders meeting in Machakos, led by Governors Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), asked the former vice president to call a meeting for the community to decide the direction to go ahead of the August 9 elections.  Last week, another meeting by party aspirants from the area asked their leader to rejoin Azimio.  On Monday, IEBC cleared Mr Musyoka’s 48,000 signatures, and he is expected to present his papers on Saturday afternoon after Deputy President William Ruto.  If he gets the blessings of Ukambani leaders to run for presidency, the Wiper leader will complicate the political arithmetic given that Azimio leadership is hoping to bag the about one million votes from his backyard.  Mr Musyoka’s allies have demanded structured talks to guarantee the specific Cabinet positions.  Besides the chief Cabinet Secretary role, the Wiper leader is reportedly lobbying for the Foreign Affairs docket, while his party should also be allocated Energy and Health ministries, among other prime seats.  The Wiper leader has left many confused on his intentions, as he has been flip-floping.
