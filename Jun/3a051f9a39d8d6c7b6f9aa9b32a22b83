A family that removed iron sheets from their house and sold them to settle their child's medical bills has a new home.  Willy Onyango and his wife Rose Odhiambo sold the iron sheets to raise a Sh10,000 hospital fee.  "Our son, Collins Onyango, 12, suffers from sickle cell anaemia and was in the hospital for several weeks," said Mr Onyango.  They had stayed in the dilapidated house for one month together with their four children when The Standard visited their Ingusi village in Mumias West, Kakamega County last month.  But yesterday, the family was happy after a well-wisher built them a double-roomed permanent house. "We had pleaded with well-wishers to support us because we feared for the worst and God answered our prayers," said Onyango.  When The Standard caught up with the couple yesterday, they were sitting calmly outside their new house with an infectious smile on their faces.  Three of their children were busy playing hide and seek to make it hard for their mother who was preparing beans for lunch to concentrate.  Although their new house lacks doors and windows, the family has already moved in. "The house is much better than the roofless one we used to stay in. We shall take care of the doors and windows later," said Onyango.  Inside one of the rooms are two wooden chairs, three plastic water jerrycans, some utensils and a trough.  The other room has two disgustingly mattresses that serve as bedding for the couple and their children.  According to Onyango, their lives took a positive turn after their plight was highlighted in The Standard.  "Two days after the story was published, I received a guest who introduced himself and offered to put up a house for me and my family. At first, I thought it was a dream," he said.  The well-wisher said that he was touched by the family's plight after reading their story.
