[Collins Oduor, Standard]  Former Governor Jack Ranguma was cleared to vie for the Kisumu governor's seat after presenting his papers to IEBC officials at Tom Mboya Labour College today.  Ranguma picked lawyer Tom Ndalo as his running mate in a bid to recapture the governor seat in August 9 polls.  He will run for the seat on Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) party ticket.  He expressed confidence in defeating Anyang Nyong'o who will defend his seat on the ODM ticket after the party awarded him a direct ticket. Nyong'o was cleared alongside his deputy Mathews Owili last Saturday. Flanked by Senator Fred Outa, ex-Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo and Kisumu women aspirant Valentine Onyango, Ranguma drummed up support for his bid as he assured supporters that he will restore Kisumu’s lost glory in matters of development and socio-economic growth.  He pledged that when elected, he will initiate projects which will improve the livelihood of county residents.  "Our plan when elected to office will be to revive the destroyed economic activities of ordinary residents which was the key backbone of Kisumu," Ranguma said.  “Before I left office, Kisumu’s economy was ahead of Kisii, but right now we cannot match Kisii’s development and growth because of poor leadership influenced by selfless individuals who do not care about the ordinary citizens.”  Ranguma further criticised Nyong'o for ruining the good plan which was drawn under his administration for the development of the Kibuye market, saying whatever has been constructed was not as per the original design.
