Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has denied claims that he is organising and training a militia group.  Speaking yesterday after recording a statement with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in Nakuru, Mandago said it is unfortunate that State agencies "are being misused by key government figures to frustrate the Kenya Kwanza coalition candidates and sabotage their campaigns".  Mandago was summoned by the DCI alongside Uasin Gishu County Assembly Speaker David Kiplagat and Cheptiret-Kipchamo MCA Gilbert Tenai to record a statement at the regional offices in Nakuru.  The three were holed up in a meeting with Rift Valley Regional Criminal Investigations Officer (RCIO) Mwenda Meme for the better part of yesterday afternoon.  “I cannot be vying for a government position and organising violence at the same time. The said group is a college of farmers in Moiben called Cheborwa. The facility is used for training farmers and other county workers,” said Mandago. He said his opponents and some county elders claimed he was training a militia group using county resources in order to hurt his Senate bid.  The outgoing governor called on individuals holding any constitutional office to discharge their duties and functions fairly as per the law.    By Stephen Rutto | 15 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 17 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 22 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 1 day ago
