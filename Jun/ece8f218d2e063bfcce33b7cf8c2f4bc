Former Assistant Inspector-General of Police Willy Lugusa has died.  Lugusa died on Monday while undergoing treatment at a Nairobi hospital.  Speaking to The Standard, Police Spokesperson Bruno Shioso said he had received news of Lugusa’s death.  “He (Lugusa) retired from the police service last year. I wish to relay my condolences to his family,” said Shioso.  Willy Lugusa retired from the service in March 2021. At the time, he was the Head of Inspectorate at the Kisumu County Government. His exit was triggered by public outcry after Kisumu City askaris were caught on tape dragging a female hawker on the road for a considerable distance.  “I hereby take full responsibility for the acts committed thereto. I hereby extend my deepest regret to all the people of Kisumu County and the nation as a whole, for this is not what the County Government of Kisumu represents,” he said in his resignation letter dated March 26, 2021.
