The High Court in Kakamega has ruled that a nurse charged with killing her two sons will be held at the Kakamega Women Prison capital remand cells throughout her hearing.  In denying her bail, Justice William Musyoka said freeing Ms Pherine Maero, a former nurse at Kakamega General Hospital, could endanger her safety as the community is still upset over the March killings.  “I have perused the pre-bail report ... it indicates the community is not ready to accept her," Justice Musyoka said.  In April, Ms Maero denied murdering her nine-year-old son Winston Limusi and Mayson Mito, seven, at Mwiyala estate in Kakamega town on March 6. She asked to be freed on “lenient bond terms” pending the determination of her case but the State said the community is still bitter against her.   The case where the State has lined up 18 witnesses will be heard between July 27 and 28 and September 27 and 28. The pathologist's report indicated the boys were strangled. Authorities are also investigating a suicide note found at the murder scene.
