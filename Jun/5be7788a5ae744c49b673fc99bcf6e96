An organisation has kicked off a drive to plant trees at the Homa Bay Prison in an effort to empower inmates.  The programme aims to guarantee the prisoners serving long-term periods a source of capital to start business when they complete their sentences.  The Green World in partnership with the Kenya Forest and the National Environment Management Authority (Nema) started planting eucalyptus trees at the prison on Wednesday.  In the project, the seedlings are provided by the organisation and planted by inmates under supervision of prison officers and the organisation’s officials. Upon maturity, the trees will be harvested and money from the sales given to inmates at the end of their jail term to help them start business ventures.  Green World Secretary General Isaac Otieno, Homa Bay County Director of Nema Josiah Nyandoro and the Prison’s Farm Manager Isaiah Ndege launched the programme.  Otieno said they are planning eucalyptus between now and December to achieve one million trees. The trees are expected to mature in three years.  He said they had identified Kenya Power and other organizations as potential buyers when the trees mature.  “The organisations will purchase the trees when they mature. The money will be given to inmates for starting businesses at home when their jail terms end,” Otieno said.  He said that the drive is aimed at enabling the inmates to practise practical skills they acquire from prison.
