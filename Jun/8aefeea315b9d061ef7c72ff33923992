Parents have been urged to protect their children from abuse and discrimination when they divorce or separate from each other.  Speaking on Thursday during celebrations to mark the International Day of the African Child in Garissa township, sub-County children's officer Benjamin Kinyua said cases of divorce in the county are on the rise.  “Children are psychologically affected when their parents' divorce or separate. In other cases, children are neglected as their mothers leave them for other marriages,” said Mr Kinyua.  “We need to establish frameworks to ensure that these children are taken care of in a good environment to enable them to grow and achieve their potential,” he added.  Other issues affecting children in the region include Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), child marriages, neglect, discrimination, online abuse and stigma against children with disability. Mr Kinyua further cautioned parents from solving cases through Maslah, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism practised by pastoral communities, which he said does not provide justice to the aggrieved and only benefits elders.  Garissa sub-County director of education, Ali Buthul, said the government has introduced a school feeding program in the region to cushion the children from the adverse effects of drought.  He said the government is also implementing a 100 per cent transition program from primary to secondary schools.  “If you know any child who is not going to school, please report them to us so that we can go to them and make sure they attend school,” said Mr Buthul.   By Edward Buri | 45 minutes ago By Daniel Chege | 45 minutes ago By Standard Team | 45 minutes ago By Ali Abdi | 3 hours ago
