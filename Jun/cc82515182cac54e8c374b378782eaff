About two thousand people have died on Kenyan roads since January this year according to statistics.  The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) says 1,912 people have died in road accidents since January 1, 2022.  Overall, the figures represent a nine per cent increase from 1,754 last year’s fatalities.  According to the safety agency, pedestrians account for the highest number of fatalities.  Six hundred and eighty-two pedestrians were killed in accidents as compared to 573 who lost their lives in the same period last year. After pedestrians, motorcyclists followed with 530 deaths; passengers (308), pillion passengers (185) and 28 pedal cyclists.  The figures were released on Thursday at Railway Training Institute in South B where 200 boda boda riders received certificates after a two-day training on First Aid and Emergency Response.  The training was conducted by St John's Ambulance in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and NTSA.   St John's Ambulance Kenya Chief Executive Officer Harun Ringera said the trained riders, will be critical in saving lives as first responders in case of an accident.  Transport ministry said the training was a pilot project that will be spread to other regions.   ''This will help the Government get appropriate feedback on the effectiveness and adequacy of the scope of the training as we prepare to roll out the entire programme across the whole country,’’ said David Ole Chege, Secretary Administration, State Department of Transport.   By Frankline Sunday | 2 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 2 hours ago By Daniel Wesangula | 2 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 2 hours ago
