Azimio la Umoja presidential running mate Martha Karua has hinted that they were still keen on building consensus among aspirants under the coalition in Mt Kenya region.  Speaking in a series of roadside rallies in Kirinyaga County, she said the move to field one candidate would boost their chances of winning many positions under the Azimio banner.  She spoke in Makutano, Ngurubani, Kutus, Kianyaga, Kiamutugu, Kamugunda, Karumande, Kimunye, Ithariene, Keruguoya, Kagumo, Kiangai, Kibirigwi, Kiburu, Baricho and Kutu.    Karua pleaded with residents to give Azimio as many seats as possible in the county. Two Azimio affiliate parties are competing for the Kirinyaga governor seat. Senator Charles Kibiru is contesting under the Jubilee Party while Muriithi Kaigai is on Narc-Kenya ticket.  Coalition line-up  “Time will come when we will sit and seek consensus on the way forward. We want to form a formidable coalition line-up that will take our opponents head-on,” she said.  She said that together with Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, they can be trusted to manage the country’s resources.  “The other side has people who are tainted with questionable character. They cannot be left alone to look at your welfare. As much as it pains them, we cannot be comfortable with the other side taking over the government,” she said.  Raila administration, she said, was the only one that can weed out the culture of corruption.  She urged voters in Mt Kenya to support Raila, saying he was the one who declared Kibaki Tosha in 2002, setting the country on the path of steady leadership and growth.  “I urge you to always remember that Raila has a track record and has spent most of his political life championing the rights of Kenyans,” she said.  She was accompanied by local aspirants as well as Royal Media Services chair SK Macharia.   By Kamau Muthoni | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 3 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 3 hours ago
