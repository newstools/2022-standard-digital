Azimio presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga says his camp is assured of victory on August 9 following the return of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka into the alliance.  He said his decision to name Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua as his running mate and Kalonzo as Chief Cabinet Secretary was the best formation for Kenya.  Raila said the Kenya Kwanza Alliance ticket of William Ruto and Rigathi Gachagua would be sent to oblivion with the final assembly of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya team.    Speaking during a rally at Mukuru kwa Njenga in Embakasi South, Nairobi yesterday, Raila said Kenya was headed for a historic moment. “We will improve the economy to ensure youth, women and the entire population is empowered through various programmes,” he said. Kalonzo said his return to rejoin Azimio two weeks after declaring his presidential bid was driven by his recognition that the good of the nation was more important than personal interests.  The former Vice President said he had taken a break to reflect on his political future and that after consultations with his party leadership, members of the clergy and professionals, he decided to make a political about-turn.  “Let me assure our rivals in Kenya Kwanza Alliance that they are now in trouble with Raila Odinga, Martha Karua and Kalonzo Musyoka working together towards in the coming elections,” he said.   Kanu chairman Gideon Moi said with Kalonzo on board, Raila would win the August election in round one. “I am very happy and full of gratitude today since we have seen Kalonzo forego his presidential ambition and support Raila for president,” said Gideon.  Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat said Kalonzo was back where he belonged. “With Gideon and Salat in Azimio we have many votes for Raila in the Rift Valley region,” said Salat.
