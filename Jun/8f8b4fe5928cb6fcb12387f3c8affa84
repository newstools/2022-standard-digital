Nyeri County has started the final phase of the Narumoru Level 4 Hospital construction.  Governor Mutahi Kahiga yesterday lay the foundation stone, saying the second phase will cost Sh72 million.  The first phase of the facility was constructed at Sh229 million.  The county received funding to construct the multimillion-shilling hospital after Nyeri was ranked second nationally under the Kenya Devolution Support Programme (KDSP) supported by World Bank.  According to the KDSP parameters, the county must adhere to the law in Public Finance Management, have elaborate county plans, and update the County Integrated Development Plan. Narumoru hospital is one of two state-of-the-art projects constructed in partnership with the County Government of Nyeri and the World Bank.  The other project is the Asian Quarters Bus Termini, with the first phase of the project costing Sh600 million.  “Health is a fully devolved function except for Level 6 hospitals. It’s a shame that county leaders are riding on the county project. Let them speak the truth,” he said.  Governor Kahiga told Naromoru residents the project will be operationalised by August.  He said another Level 4 Hospital will be constructed at Kiawara, Kieni West sub-county in the future after the county government acquired a 14-acre land.
