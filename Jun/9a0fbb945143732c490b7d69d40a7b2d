A four-year-old boy is recuperating at a Nairobi hospital after he was allegedly defiled by his mother’s lover.  Police were notified of the incident by the victim’s teacher after the PP1 pupil narrated how the perpetrator, 32, would molest him while his mother was away.  The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti has confirmed that the suspect, a bodaboda rider, and the mother are being held by police and are currently being interrogated over the claims.  “We have managed to arrest the two who are currently held at Parklands Police Station as our officers finalise investigations. We will arraign them in court once detectives conclude their work,” Kinoti said.  According to the Sexual Offences Act; “A person who commits an act which causes penetration with a child is guilty of an offence termed defilement, whereas a person who commits an offence of defilement with a child aged eleven years or less shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for life.” According to the Act, the crimes of sexual acts with minors include touching of private parts, exposure of genitalia, taking of pornographic pictures, rape, inducement of sexual acts with the molester or with other children, and variations of these acts.
