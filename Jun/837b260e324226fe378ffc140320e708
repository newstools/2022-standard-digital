Celebrated gospel artiste Reuben Kigame has sued the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).  He wants it compelled to clear him to contest the presidential race.  Mr Kigame accused the Wafula Chebukati-led commission of bias and unfairness. He said IEBC extended the time for presidential candidates to table their signatures and at least 2,000 copies of voters’ identification cards from a majority counties only for it to allegedly reject his.    The singer said the commission is unfair to disabled persons as it has not developed regulations to assist them or provided necessary materials. “The petitioner has worked hard and has met all the requirements on the checklist, only to be barred from presenting the booklets that have cost him time and a lot of resources. The IEBC failed to grant the petitioner access materials and devices to overcome constraints arising from his disability,” his lawyer John Khaminwa said.  According to Dr Khaminwa, Mr Kigame attended the pre-nomination meeting for presidential candidates. He said the commission agreed to add presidential candidates two more days to have their signatures and copies of IDs in order. This was on May 23.  Six days later when Mr Kigame presented his signatures at Bomas, the commission declined to receive them. “The petitioner’s materials were not received despite their request with the officials confirming that they had allowed the extension, but they could not receive the documents,” Dr Khaminwa said.  In the court papers, Mr Kigame says he waited until 10pm when an official of the commission asked him for his email address. According to him, Mr Chebukati wrote him an email indicating that he had not complied with the nomination process.  The Huniachi composer says he is yet to receive any explanation from IEBC.
