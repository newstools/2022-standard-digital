The United States government maintains it will support Kenya in ensuring a free and fair General Election on August 9.  On his official Twitter page, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, welcomed the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC's) certification of candidates as well as the start of the campaign period in the Country.  "As I said to CS Raychelle Omamo last month, the United States stands with Kenyans in support of free, fair, and peaceful elections," Blinken said.  Blinken's statement came days after IEBC chairperson Wafula Chabukati finalized the registration of Presidential candidates.  According to the IEBC, presidential candidates who met the requisite constitutional and statutory requirements are; David Mwaure Waihiga (Agano Party), Prof. George Wajackoyah (Roots Party), Raila Odinga (Azimio Coalition Political Party) and William Ruto (United Democratic Alliance). In November, when Blinken visited the country, he said it was critical for all parties including the government, opposition parties and civil societies, to work together to ensure stable elections that reflect the will of the Kenyan people.
