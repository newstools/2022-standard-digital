Interior CS Fred Matiang’i will today (Friday, June 3) chair a high-level security agencies meeting for a review of elections preparedness ahead of August polls.  The meeting comes in the wake of heightened political temperatures in the country with barely two months to the general elections.  Senior police officers including the National Government Administration Officers (NGOs) will convene at Administration Police Training College (APTC) in Embakasi in Nairobi to discuss among other issues, ways of managing security during and after the general elections.  Matiang’i’s meeting comes just days after the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) released a report listing six counties as potential hotspots for election-related violence.  NCIC listed Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu as high-risk counties for potential election-related violence. Other counties on the list include: Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, and Kericho.  The commission’s Technical Committee chairman Danvas Makori expressed fears that increased hate speech by political leaders could be a trigger for violence calling on political leaders to be cautious of their statements.  Out of the remaining 41 counties, 10 counties including Narok, Marsabit, Laikipia, Lamu, Baringo, Isiolo, Meru, Nandi, Samburu and Bomet depict a medium high-risk Kenya Electoral Violence Index-County (KEVI-C) while 23 counties depict a medium low-risk vulnerability in terms of electoral violence.  The report further ranked 8 counties including Kajiado, Kitui, Tharaka Nithi, Taita Taveta, Busia, Makueni, Nyandarua, and Embu, depict a low-risk vulnerability to electoral violence.
