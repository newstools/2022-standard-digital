Rigathi Gachagua at ACK Mother Church in Kabete where he condemned the media over what he termed as ‘unfair coverage’. [George Njunge, Standard]  The Kenya Kwanza Alliance has appealed to the media to be fair and balanced in covering the campaigns.  Deputy President William Ruto's running mate Rigathi Gachagua said media coverage had been skewed in favour of the Azimio la Umoja coalition. The Mathira MP accused vernacular radio stations of having what he called a vendetta against his camp.  Speaking at the ACK Kabete Mother church, Gachagua challenged journalists to put the interest of the country first.  “From morning to evening, you're inviting members of Azimio camp to discuss various political issues in the most unbalanced of manner. We have able Kenya Kwanza foot soldiers who can come and battle it out with our competitors in the shows but you chose not to invite us,” Gachagua said.  He asked the media to focus on informing Kenyans on topical issues in instead of appearing to be mouthpieces of Azimio la Umoja.   "In the morning, we hear discussions on radio. Mid-morning and in the night, the same people speak. We can see the skewed campaign in the stations and I want our people to stop listening to them if this is the trend," said Gachagua.   DP Ruto recently accused the media of biased reporting. He said he would not take part in the presidential debate.   "We have taken note on the unequal allocation of coverage compounded by biased framing and negative profiling of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance campaign team and personalities affiliated to it,” said the DP's campaign communications director Huseein Mohammed in a statement.    By Muriithi Mugo | 4 hours ago By Dominic Omondi | 5 hours ago By Jacob Ng’etich and Grace Ng'ang'a | 5 hours ago By Tony Sisule | 5 hours ago
