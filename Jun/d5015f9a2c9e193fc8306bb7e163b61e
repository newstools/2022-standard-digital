ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru has assured Kenyans of free and fair elections in the August 9 General Election.  Mucheru stated that his office was committed to ensure that all polling stations have access to a sufficient network, with a goal of achieving a 10 per cent coverage rate.  His statement comes as the Kenya Kwanza team, led by Deputy President William Ruto, has accused him (Mucheru) of participating in partisan political campaigns calling for his resignation.  Mucheru stated that the network connection will aid in resolving issues that arose during the 2017 elections when certain polling locations suffered delays in reporting results.  Speaking on the KTN News Checkpoint show on Sunday, June 12, Mucheru denied his office was out to sway the outcome of the August elections in favor of Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga. "As a Cabinet Secretary, I am very comfortable in my position. I'm fulfilling my role as a minister, and no one has stopped me from expressing my views on who I support or don't," he said.  "I have not instructed or directed anyone to vote in a specific manner. I've already decided where I'll vote and how I'll vote."  He, however, expressed confidence that Raila Odinga, the Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate, and his running mate, Martha Karua, would win the polls.  "There are several reports that I continue to see and those numbers continue to change. The numbers are actually in favour of Raila Odinga. It is now over 64 per cent," said Mucheru.  Mucheru’s statement comes even as the Kenya Kwanza team led by Deputy President William Ruto accused Mucheru of partiality.  In a statement, Kenya Kwanza said they were concerned about Mucheru's political stand, claiming the office he holds could play a role in determining who wins the elections.
