The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has arrested ten police recruits for alleged forgery of academic documents.  Their arrest came three months after being shortlisted for training pending confirmation as police officers.  The ten were arrested while undergoing training at the National Police College Main Campus-Kiganjo after a verification exercise was conducted.  “A report forwarded to the college by the Kenya National Examination Council (KNEC) declared their Kenya Certificate of Secondary School Education documents presented by the recruits as forged,” DCI has said. “Investigations into their forged certificates indicated that some subject grades and mean grades had been deliberately altered to match the needed minimum requirements for joining the service,”  A tweet by the DCI on Thursday evening identified the ten as Mochama Opiyo Clive, Muithi John Kitavi, Natembea M. Kelvin, Nyapola Felix Angatia, Mwaulid Galgalo Bide, Gobra Grindguest, Ndambuki Irene Nzisa, Felix Kipkoech Langat, Kabatha Paul Kimani and John Crispus Amisi.  The suspects were arrested, the forged documents confiscated and they were also delisted from the police training.  ” The suspects have since lost their slots in the service, after failing the integrity test and three months of rigorous training behind the thick well-manicured Kayaba hedgerow, that is characteristic of the Kiganjo police training college,” DCI tweeted.  They are currently being held at Kiganjo police station pending arraignment for forgery among other unspecified charges.  The ten are among 5,000 police constables who were recruited in March this year, as part of the government’s efforts to increase the ratio of Police to civilians in order to improve service delivery to Kenyans, DCI says.
