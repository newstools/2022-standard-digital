Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives have arrested a suspected international fugitive facing organised crime charges in Sudan.  Mohamed Nagi Mohamed Magzoub, a Sudanese national, was flushed out of his hideout in the city on Monday, June 6.  According to the DCI, Magzoub was captured at the University of Nairobi staff headquarters.  DCI says he was arrested following a stealth operation conducted by Transnational and organised Crimes detectives acting on a tip-off from the public.  “Arrangements to extradite the suspect to his home country where he will face justice are currently in top gear, as the Directorate looks for the next available flight to Khartoum, to hand him over to Sudanese authorities,” the DCI said in a Twitter post. “The Directorate has in recent months registered an increase in arrests of international fugitives wanted for serious crimes in their countries,” said DCI.   By David Njaaga | 3 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 6 hours ago By Nancy Nzau | 2 days ago By Hudson Gumbihi | 2 days ago
