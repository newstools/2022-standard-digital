Three people died today in Manyani, Nakuru East when a fire gutted their house.   The deceased were a mother and her two daughters who were found in their bedrooms, according to Nakuru East Deputy Sub-County Police Commander Wilson Nduati.   “At around, 8am we received reports that a house was on fire within Manyani slums. After the fire was put out, we established that three people had died in the house,” said Nduati.   The police boss said that the cause of the fire was not immediately established.  “The three were burnt beyond recognition. We have launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire,” said Nduati.  The middle-aged woman was survived by her only son Kenan Muchemi, 19.  “Those who were in the house were my mother Judy Nyambura and my two sisters Shadiya Wangare, 17, and Limsy Wanjiru, 11,” said Muchemi, who recently completed high school and was lucky to escape the tragedy as he had moved out of home.  “I have been living with my cousins in a neighbouring estate but I come to check on them. This morning I came home only to find residents putting out the fire,” said Muchemi.  Josephat Juma, a neighbour said that he was alerted by a resident who spotted unusual smoke billowing from small spaces on the roofing of the house.   “From the balcony of a house under construction, we established that the house was on fire,” said Juma.  George Karanja, a witness said that they were not sure if there were people inside the house when they responded.  “The house had a padlock on the door which would have either been locked from inside or outside,” said Karanja.
