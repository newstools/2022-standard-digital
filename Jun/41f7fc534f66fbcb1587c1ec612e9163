Religious leaders have called for peaceful campaigns as the country gears for the August elections.  In a message directed to the youth, the Evangelical Alliance of Kenya (EAK) appealed to young Kenyans not to be incited to lawlessness and violence before, during and after the polls.  "Some candidates may wish to incite Kenyans or use violence to gain an advantage over their opponents. This is unacceptable and we urge all candidates to conduct themselves peacefully," said EAK chairman Bishop David Oginde.  The religious leaders encouraged Kenyans to dedicate time to praying for peaceful, free, fair and credible elections.  "We urge you to vet all candidates, not by their communities and hefty pockets, but for their good character and ability to lead," Bishop Oginde added. On security, the EAK urged security agencies to take their mandate seriously to maintain law and order.  While lauding the government's security operation in Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot counties, the alliance said more needs to be done to address insecurity in the Kerio Valley.  The religious leaders cautioned politicians against making disparaging remarks against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and judicial officers.   "Honour to the IEBC and the judiciary will uphold their critical role to manage the election,"  said EAK general secretary Bishop Nelson Makanda.  Mr Makanda asked the IEBC, National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Registrar of Political Parties to execute their mandate impartially.
