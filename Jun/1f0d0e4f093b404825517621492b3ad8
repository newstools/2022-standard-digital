The government has suspended the creation of new administrative units in Eastern and North Eastern regions.   It has also put on hold land adjudication and issuance of title deeds in areas around contested boundaries and disputed territories till the August General Election is held.   Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said the moratorium that will affect sub-counties, locations and sub-locations with ongoing disputes will allow for more consultations.  Dr Matiang'i said although the creation of new units is intended to deliver government services closer to citizens, the process had been hijacked by leaders for political aggrandizement and partisan agenda.   “Even when we have tried to create some of these administrative units with all the good intentions, slowly, but surely it looks like we are engendering a new conflict,” Matiang’i said after chairing a meeting of security teams in Isiolo and Meru counties. The two counties have a conflict along the border that has led to the the killing of residents and camels and cattle rustling in the last few years.  The CS said land dispute was a key contributor to the cross-county conflicts adding that the moratorium will enable the Ministry of Lands and relevant institutions to devise effective adjudication and resource-sharing strategies.  Several counties in the two regions have been experiencing cross-border conflicts over boundaries, pasture and water. The areas are Meru, Isiolo, Tharaka Nithi, Garissa, Kitui, Tana River, Makueni and Taita Taveta.
