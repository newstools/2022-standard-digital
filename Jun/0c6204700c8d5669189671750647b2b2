Bhang will be peddled and smoked openly but corrupt individuals will be hanged from August 9, if Roots presidential candidate Prof George Wajackoyah wins the presidential elections.  Speaking at the Bomas of Kenya after being cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to run for presidency, Wajackoyah said his first mission will be legalising marijuana use.  According to the candidate, his mega project where he will start marijuana farming will be in Bunyore, Western region.    “That will be our viable project since it is one of the best climate to grow marijuana naturally," he said. At the same time, also gave a warning to institutions like the Judiciary over corruption vowing that his administration will not let any corrupt judge walk free.  “Corrupt judges will be the first ones to be hanged because they have made this country to be a pariah’s State.  Why would you keep one case going on for so long?" he posed  But as Wajackoyah celebrated his belated clearance, it was the end of the road for presidential hopeful Justus Juma of the Justice and Freedom Party after his bid was rejected.  Juma who was reappearing at the presidential registration centre at the Bomas of Kenya yesterday got a rude shock after Chebukati said he failed to meet the checklist of requirements.  Also rejected was independent candidate Gibson Ngaruiya Ng'ang'a who also failed to meet some of the key requirements by the IEBC.  Independent candidate Dorothy Kemunto was also rejected and given until today to ensure she has everything in order.  Today independent candidates Jeremiah Nyagah, Jane Juliet Munyeki and David Mwaure Waihiga of Agano party will be vetted​.   By The Conversation | 2 hours ago By Edwin Nyarangi | 2 hours ago By Jacob Ngetich | 2 hours ago By George Kaimenyi | 2 hours ago
