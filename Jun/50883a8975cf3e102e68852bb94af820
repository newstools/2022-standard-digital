Two middle-aged women gave birth while attending a Kenya Kwanza rally in Kisii on Monday afternoon.  The two arrived at the Kisii UDA governorship candidate Ezikel Machogu's Nyaribari Masaba home minutes on Monday morning ready to attend the scheduled political rally.  They each gave birth to baby boys in a difference of 30 minutes.  Elderly women who were part of the gathering acted as midwives and successfully aided the two through labour and delivery.  The two mothers stayed at Machogu's house throughout the day as he promised to take care of the newborns. "This is a blessing to my family and I promise to give them the necessary support," said Machogu.   The rally was also attended by other UDA candidates including Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Party coordinator Okengo Nyambane and South Mugirango MP Slyvanous  Osoro.
