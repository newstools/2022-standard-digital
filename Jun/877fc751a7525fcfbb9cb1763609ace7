Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka (pictured) has promised to introduce a tax holiday for traders if elected Bungoma governor.  According to Mr Lusaka, traders will not pay taxes to the county government during weekends and public holidays due to hard economic times.  He said the tax holiday will help cushion traders and boost enterprises owned by the youth, women and people living with disabilities.  "Many traders are currently undergoing harsh economic times, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, and we must help them pick up by cushioning them from paying hefty taxes," said the former governor.   Lusaka said his administration will also introduce affordable trade loans for groups as was the case when he served as governor between 2013 and 2017.   “We want to bring back the women empowerment fund where we used to give traders loans to start and grow their enterprises. We will also ensure the youth are properly empowered by making sure the 30 per cent tender allocation to them is fully implemented,” he said.  Lusaka faulted the current county administration over what he termed as outsourcing of contractors at the expense of locals who are capable of doing a good job.  He said devolution is meant to improve the living standards of the people within a county.  “Almost all projects in this county have been given out to people from outside Bungoma. We will reverse this trend," said Lusaka.  By Robert Amalemba | 10 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago By Bernard Lusigi | 2 days ago By Kamau Muthoni | 3 days ago
