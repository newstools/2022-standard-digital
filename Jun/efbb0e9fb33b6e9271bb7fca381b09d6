Deputy President William Ruto is welcomed by Nominated MP David Ole Sank and Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura. [Edward Kiplimo, Standard]  Deputy President William Ruto has pledged to look into the issues affecting persons with disabilities if elected president in the August 9 polls.  On Wednesday while meeting a section of Persons living with Disabilities (PwDs) in Karen, Nairobi, noted that his office will provide a special education scholarship to PwDs to better their education.  The aim, he said, will be to give equal chances to every person irrespective of their background.  “We will ensure we have given people with disabilities the best chance to acquire knowledge,” he said. Ruto said his administration will also actualise opportunities for the youth to do business, by working with the private sector to provide tax incentives.  “The services will be devolved to every county, with an intention of expanding the tax base,” he said.  “Many disabled people want to pay taxes if they have businesses that are doing well, but most of them have no access to credit, business opportunities or even contracts and so cannot contribute meaningfully to growing our country.”  DP Ruto has been traversing the country, holding town hall meetings with residents as popularizes his presidential bid.
