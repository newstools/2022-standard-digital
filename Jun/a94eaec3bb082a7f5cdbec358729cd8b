United Democratic Alliance (UDA) leaders hit the campaign trail in Nakuru with calls to residents to embrace six-piece voting.  Candidates from other parties in the Kenya Kwanza coalition who attended the rallies held in Rongai, Bahati and Subukia constituencies said they felt isolated.  They said what was fashioned as the alliance’s campaigns ended up being a UDA affair, where the party’s candidates were paraded.    During each of the stopovers, William Ruto’s running mate, who was leading the campaign team, urged the locals to vote for UDA candidates. The campaign team is in Nakuru for a five days.  Mr Gachagua was accompanied by Chama cha Kazi leader Moses Kuria, Senator Susan Kihika, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Liza Chelule (Woman Rep Nakuru), UDA senatorial aspirant Tabitha Karanja, Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri, Charity Khatambi (Njoro) and Jayne Kihara (Naivasha) among others.  “Give us people who we will work with, give us a UDA governor, a UDA MP, UDA woman rep and also in the Senate. We have our own in each of the seats,” said Gachagua.  At Ol-Rongai, the UDA candidates were recognised and given a chance to address the rally.  Amani National Congress Woman Representative candidate Eunice Lelei said the rally was a UDA affair.  At Ol-Rongai, Kuria recognised a Member of County Assembly aspirant vying on his Chama Cha Kazi ticket.  “All along, this was not a Kenya Kwanza meeting and as aspirants of affiliate parties we feel left out,” said Lelei.  Maryanne Nyaruai, Bahati Ward MCA aspirant on ANC ticket, said she had to write a note to Kihika to have them recognised.  “We were not accorded a chance to speak,” she said.  Nyaruai noted that they have been campaigning for Kenya Kwanza and not ANC.
