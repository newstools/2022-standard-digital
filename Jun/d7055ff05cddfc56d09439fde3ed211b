Police officers in Embakasi have launched investigations into a love-triangle scuffle that left one of their colleagues nursing injuries in hospital.  The officer, according to DCI, is attached to Kware Police Station in Embakasi.  A tweet by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) indicated that the ailing officer left his workstation and went for a drink at the Villa police station canteen.  At the canteen, the unnamed officer was embroiled in conversation with one of the attendants who was serving her. “Mueni appeared to have been smitten by the recently graduated officer as, she would sit next to him giggling in excitement, whenever she was not serving the rest of the patrons,” the DCI tweet reads in part.  “This however did not go down well with her colleague Favian Nekesa, who was seated behind the counter burning with rage, her eyes rolling in anger. Unbeknownst to Mueni, her colleague was equally attracted to the cop with an athletic physique and a neatly trimmed moustache,” the sleuths say.  As the two were engrossed in their conversation, Nekesa, a former lover of the officer pounced on the duo and attacked them.  “The two injured lovebirds who had just met were then escorted to nearby Mukuru health centre for medical attention and allowed to go home,” DCI said.  However, the officer’s condition deteriorated, and at around 3 am, he was rushed to a city hospital where he is currently admitted in stable condition nursing his wounds.
