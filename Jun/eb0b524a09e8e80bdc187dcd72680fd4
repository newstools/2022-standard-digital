The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's Dispute Resolution Committee has cleared Wavinya Ndeti of the Wiper Party to run for Machakos governorship  While issuing its final verdict on the case, the panel dismissed a petition challenging the validity of her degree.  Her clearance came just a day after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji directed the Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to expedite the investigation into the academic certificates held by politicians.  Haji has asked Mutyambai to expand the scope of investigations beyond Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja and Machakos gubernatorial aspirant Wavinya Ndeti who were under probe over academic certificate-forgery allegations.  Ndeti’s academic credentials were disputed before the IEBC’s Dispute Resolution Committee by two Machakos County voters identified as Gideon Ngewa Kenya and Kisilu Mutisya. The petitioners argued that the aspirant presented different degrees to the IEBC for clearance in the 2013 and 2017 elections.  In her defence, Ndeti said she holds a valid bachelor’s degree, and that the petitioners who claim she lacks tertiary education are bent on misleading the country.  “During the 2013 and 2017 general elections, I presented the above credentials and I was cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to vie for the gubernatorial seat for Machakos County,” she said in her affidavit.
