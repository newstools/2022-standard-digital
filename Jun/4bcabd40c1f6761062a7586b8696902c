A showdown is looming in Kakamega today after Kenya Kwanza booked Bukhungu Stadium for a rally where Deputy President William Ruto is expected to hold a meeting even as the Kakamega Homeboyz team plans to play their final match at the same venue.  Speaking at Bukhungu Stadium yesterday during an inspection of the venue, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala said they have booked the stadium at a cost of Sh100,000.  “We have paid the money and we have even gone ahead and written a letter to the county government of Kakamega which has given us a go-ahead for our meeting and, therefore, we expect nothing less,” said Malala.  When asked about the Homeboyz versus Kariobangi Shark fixture, Malala said they would provide an alternative since the rally was a ‘national’ event.  Malala said the meeting was for the unveiling Ruto’s western region presidential campaign team during which leaders will also table a wish list to the DP as they eye a 30 per cent government share in a Kenya Kwanza government. Former Senator Boni Khalwale asked their supporters to turn out in large numbers and even asked Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to use the chance to shift from Azimio.  “We are telling our brother Oparanya that, being a good and smart politician, he should come to our winning side and we are going to offer him a better position than he is being offered in Azimio,” said Khalwale, adding the DP respects Western leaders, including Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula.  “We agreed with Ruto on sharing deal. We are the ones who proposed the 30 per cent target and we are going to achieve it. If we delivered for Kibaki and Raila, we are going to deliver for Ruto,” said Khalwale.
