Kenya Kwanza presidential running mate Rigathi Gachagua has urged voters in Meru to only vote for UDA candidates despite disquiet among coalition members who are against six-piece voting.  Gachagua addressed residents in several stops in Igembe and Tigania during his two-day tour of Meru, where he said for Deputy President William Ruto to have a strong government, residents of Meru should cast their ballots in favour of UDA.  For governor, senator and woman rep positions, Gachagua asked them to vote in Meru Senator Mithika Linturi, Kiraitu Murungi and Elizabeth Kailemia, respectively.  Gachagua rooted for Tigania West MP John Mutunga to get a second term, pledging that the legislator, an agriculture expert, would be made the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the National Assembly.  “I have worked with Mutunga in the National Assembly and he is an expert in matters of agriculture. We need him in Ruto’s government and will appoint him to head the agriculture committee,” he said. He said even as supporters vote for DP Ruto, he needed a strong team that will push his government’s agenda in the two levels of Parliament.  “When you are voting for Ruto and Gachagua we cannot do much if we do not have a team made up of people who understand us and will push our agenda,” he said.   By Muriithi Mugo | 1 day ago By Philip Muasya | 3 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 3 days ago By Muriithi Mugo | 5 days ago
