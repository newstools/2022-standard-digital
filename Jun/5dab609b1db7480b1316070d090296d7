At least two people were injured yesterday when supporters of two different political camps clashed at the Jacaranda Grounds in Embakasi, Nairobi.  That confrontation was needless and shameful. While it was stupid and criminal for the supporters to engage in running battles, someone must be held to account for this clash.  How the two sides; Kenya Kwanza Alliance and Azimio ended up at the same venue is incomprehensible. It must be established who authored the confusion that led to the confrontation and action can be taken against them. Political antagonism is no reason to set Kenyans against each other. The law must take its course.  By Editorial | 5 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 3 days ago By Editorial | 4 days ago
