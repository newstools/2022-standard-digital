The identities of three men whose mutilated bodies were found in Ngubi Forest, Kiambu County on Sunday, June 19 have been established.  The fourth victim is, however, yet to be identified.  City Mortuary superintendent Patrick Kibugi told The Standard that the three identified victims are Fredrick Obare Mokaya, Moses Amenya Nyachae, and Pernus Wanjohi.  “One body was brought to City Mortuary on Saturday, while the other three were brought to the facility on Sunday,” said Kibugi.  The victims succumbed to stab injuries, with a postmortem conducted on two bodies indicating they bled to death after being stabbed in the neck. They also had strangulation marks. Police said preliminary investigations indicated that the four were murdered elsewhere and their bodies dumped in Ngubi Forest on the Nairobi-Mai Mahiu Road.  Lari Sub-County Police Commander Adamson Furaha confirmed the incident, expressing concern at the rising number of bodies dumped in the forest.
