Sarah Joslyn who worked as a house help was granted a letter of administration for the property with an estimated value of Sh74 million. [Daniel Chege]   A Nakuru businessman has moved to court to be given 100 acres of land left to a former 'housemaid' of British tycoon Richard Ingram.  Wycliffe Waita has filed a case against Sarah Joslyn (pictured) before  Justice Francis Njoroge of the Environment and Land Court in Nakuru.  Joslyn, who is said to have worked for Ingram as a house help before he died on February 1, 2014, was granted a letter of administration for property with an estimated value of Sh74 million.  Her grant of letters of administration was confirmed by Justice Teresia Matheka last year after a seven-year court battle. However, Waita claims that Sarah improperly took ownership of the 100-acre tract of land, which was subdivided three times.  “The defendant (Sarah) evicted me from the property, claiming it was part of Ingram’s estate,” he claims in documents filed in court.  He wants Judge Mutungi to permanently restrain Sarah from trespassing,  selling or subdividing the property.  In her response, Joslyn said Waita’s case is defective and should be dismissed. The court will rule on October 3.   By Titus Too | 45 minutes ago By Standard Team | 45 minutes ago By Collins Kweyu | 10 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 13 hours ago
