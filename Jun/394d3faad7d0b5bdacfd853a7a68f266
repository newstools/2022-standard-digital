Kisumu City Manager Abala Wanga addresses a section of matatu operators protesting the decision by the county government to ban them from accessing the CBD. [Collins Oduor, Standard]  Travellers were stranded for hours in Kisumu after matatu operators withdrew their vehicles to protest re-routing of their vehicles.  Students trekked for several kilometres to and from school.  There was tension at Kondele as the operators gathered to protest a decision by the county government to bar vehicles from accessing the Central Business District.  They claimed they would only resume services after they were allowed to use their usual routes.   They claimed the rerouting had affected their business since passengers had shifted to other means of transportation.  Nicodema Ongaro, a driver, told The Standard they have been struggling to find customers since they were re-routed.  A meeting between city manager Abala Wanga and some operators to solve the issue ended prematurely after rowdy operators disrupted the meeting.  Mr Abala appealed for calm and said the matter was being discussed with an aim of finding a solution that favours both parties.   By Washington Onyango | 12 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo | 2 days ago By Harold Otieno Odhiambo | 4 days ago By Anne Atieno | 4 days ago
