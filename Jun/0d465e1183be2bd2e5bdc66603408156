At least 30,000 people are expected to attend the 59th Madaraka Day celebrations at the Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi with this year’s theme being ‘Pamoja Tusonge Mbele.’  Hundreds took their seats at the terraces very early in the morning in readiness for the celebrations which come after a two-year hiatus prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic that almost crumbled economies world over.  The gates were opened at exactly 6 am.  Security has been heightened with both the military, Kenya Police and Administration Police taking charge at both the various entrances and within the stadium.  Various dignitaries including diplomats, Governors, Cabinet Secretaries, and MPs arrived early and were ushered through Gate 3. Traffic police officers have also taken charge to direct traffic to the venue with various parking grounds set aside to host those arriving.  Those thronging the venue that cost the government Sh70 million for preparations were forced to wear face masks due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Entertainment groups also took to the stage with plays, traditional dances, poems and patriotic songs as the crowd cheered on while waving the Kenyan flags.  President Uhuru Kenyatta arrived at the venue around 11am. He is also expected to commission Uhuru Gardens which has been under construction for close to two years.  This is President Kenyatta's last Madaraka day in his tenure.   By Brian Otieno | 1 hour ago By President Uhuru Kenyatta | 4 hours ago By David Njaaga | 6 hours ago By George Maringa | 7 hours ago
