The Ministry of Education has effected leadership changes in three schools in Murang’a County.  Gerrison Mwangi who has been the principal of Kiaguthu Boys School has been moved to Njiiri High to replace Kamau Chomba, who leaves to head Alliance High School in Kiambu.  At Kiaguthu Boys in Murang’a, Mwangi handed the institution's leadership to Kagema Kibue from Karega Mixed Day Secondary School in Kigumo.  Mwangi has been at Kiaguthu since 2016, after he took over for Wilson Kamunya who was transferred to Ndururumo High School in Nyahururu.  Speaking yesterday, Mwangi said he had worked with the stakeholders to improve the school's performance leading to a high number of students qualifying for university admission in the last six years. “I have worked with several institutions and all geared towards better returns at the national level,” said Mwangi on the day he started his tour of duty at Njiiri.  Kagema said he was delighted to be at Kiaguthu High where he promised to work with all stakeholders to improve performance.  “The issue is to work hand in hand with stakeholders for the interest of the students,” said Kagema.  At Karega, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) promoted Stephen Mburu, a former teacher at St Mary Lioki in Kiambu, to replace Kagema.
