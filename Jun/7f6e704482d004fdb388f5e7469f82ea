Police have launched a manhunt for suspects who shot two people dead at Adams Arcade in Nairobi last Saturday.  The suspects are believed to be targeting mobile money shops, where they steal cash and other valuables.  On June 11, they shot dead a 53-year-old woman at her M-Pesa shop during an attempted robbery.  Surveillance camera recordings showed a gunman shooting the woman in attempts to forcefully enter her shop. The incident occurred at 7pm, and police now say the suspect had raided the victim’s shop with an accomplice.  The victim identified as Sophia Gathoni Maina died on Tuesday, June 14 while receiving treatment at a city hospital. On the same day of robbery – Saturday – a 50-year-old man who responded to witnesses’ distress calls was also shot dead by the suspects.  Police have identified him as Paul Githinji Gitau.  “While fleeing, the robbers shot indiscriminately, killing Gitau on the spot. The deceased had a gunshot wound to the head,” Kilimani Sub-County Police Commander Andrew Mbogo told The Standard.  “We’ve launched a manhunt for the suspects, and we believe we’ll soon arrest them,” said Mbogo.  The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) shared a picture on their Twitter page of a man suspected to be part of mobile money shops robbery syndicate.  The suspect was allegedly caught on CCTV cameras stealing from an M-Pesa stall within Nairobi.
