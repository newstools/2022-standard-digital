The Government has announced a 30-day dusk to dawn curfew in parts of Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, and West Pokot Counties affected by insecurity.  Speaking in Baringo, Rift Valley Regional Commissioner Maalim Mohamed said the order is effective immediately and will apply between the hours of 6pm and 6am.  “Effective today June 7, 2022, we are going to impose dusk to dawn curfew in the three counties of Kerio Valley for 30 days,” said Maalim.  Areas affected:  In Elgeyo Marakwet, the entire Tot ward with eight locations, six locations in Chesongoch ward, and Kapyego location. As well as Marakwet West areas of Chesuman and Arror locations. In Baringo County, Tiaty Sub-County will be affected. Baringo North will be partly affected in areas of Sibilo, Yatya and Kinyach.  In West Pokot, Chesegon and Sigor wards will be affected.  A special Deputy County Commissioner, Bernard George, has also been appointed in the area.  During the curfew hours, the Regional Commissioner said there would be no public gatherings or processions.  He noted that the orders shall not apply to specialised groups including medics, security agencies and the administration, public health and sanitation officers, and licensed broadcasters and media houses.  Maalim said they have witnessed the continued loss of life along the Kerio Valley belt, noting that efforts for dialogue failed forcing the government to enforce a curfew.  “We cannot continue witnessing what is happening in the Kerio Valley belt and we have been challenged as a government,” he said.  The locals have been calling for a state action to end the insecurity menace.  Last week three children were killed in the Tot area by suspected bandits.  jchepkwony@standardmedia.co.ke      By Kennedy Gachuhi | 1 hour ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 1 day ago By Bradley Sikolia | 1 day ago By Stephen Rutto | 1 day ago
