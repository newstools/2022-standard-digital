For a long time, courts have been accused of being the weak link in the war against corruption.  However, the hefty fines imposed on four people convicted of defrauding pensioners on Monday is proof enough that our magistrates and judges are ready to do the right thing if provided with irrefutable evidence.  The whopping Sh9.6 billion fines, almost nine times the Sh1.2 billion that they stole from National Social Security Fund (NSSF), to former NSSF Investment Manager Francis Moturi and three managers of Discount Securities Limited should serve as warning to anyone intending to steal from the public.  It is also a reminder to those who have stolen from Wanjiku, including those who looted Kenya Medical Supplies Authority amid a pandemic that when their day comes, there will be no mercy from the court.
