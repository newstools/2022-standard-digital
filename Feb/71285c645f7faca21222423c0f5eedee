Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Planning Hon. Amb. Ukur Yatani [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  The proposal by MPs that borrowing be capped at Sh400 billion or 3.2 per cent of the gross domestic product every financial year should be given the seriousness that it deserves.  Kenya's national debt has grown by leaps and bounds over the past nine years to to nearly Sh8 trillion. However, this has done little to what Jubilee government's appetite for borrowing.  Kenya is now in debt crisis, according to the UK-based Jubilee Debt Campaign. Indeed, there have reports that the government sometimes borrows to offset debts.  There is need to stop this borrowing spree before things get out hand. Capping the amount of money that the government can borrow is a good starting point. It is important that the government learns to live within its means.  By Editorial | 9 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
