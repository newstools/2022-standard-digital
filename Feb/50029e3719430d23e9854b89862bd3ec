Wajir Governor Ahmed Mukhtar. [Edward Kiplimo, Standard]  Wajir Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar and several of his supporters have decamped to Kanu.  The governor, who was accompanied by a delegation from Wajir was received into the party by Kanu chairman Gideon Moi at his private office at the weekend.  “I have today joined the Independence party Kanu and I will seek the mandate of the people of Wajir in 2022 through this party,” said Mukhtar.  Mukhtar added Wajir and Garissa residents consider Kanu as their home and are ready to vote for the party’s candidates. The governor is currently embroiled in a tussle with his predecessor Mahmoud Mohammed who was recently reinstated by court to the seat. Mohammed had been impeached by the Wajir County Assembly last year.    Gideon assured the governor of his support, saying Kanu is prepared to field candidates in all elective seats in Garissa and Wajir and support them.  “We are back to business as Kanu and 2022 is business unusual for us. We will field candidates in all positions, particularly in Wajir and Garissa and we are going for nothing less than victory,” said Moi.  Gideon, who is also the Baringo Senator, said many more defections will be witnessed in the coming days since many MPs from various political parties have privately expressed their interests to run on a Kanu ticket.
