Dozens of touts were arrested yesterday evening along Tom Mboya and Ronald Ngala streets in Nairobi for flouting the law requiring them to wear uniforms and display their badges.  The operation was carried out jointly by the police and officers from the Nairobi county government inspectorate department.  Those arrested were taken to Kamukunji Police Station.  A police officer involved in the crackdown said they are determined to implement the city bylaw that requires crews of Public Service Vehicles to wear uniforms and display their badges.  The officer who did not wish to be named added: "We are also enforcing the rule that forbids the touts from calling out for customers in certain places to avoid noise pollution as per the National Environment Management Authority requirements." "We are insisting on the uniforms and display of badges because it will help us distinguish touts from criminals who have been trying to infiltrate the sector by posing as matatu operators."  Central Deputy OCPD Doris Kemey said they also want to ensure hawkers sell their merchandise from designated areas to prevent them from blocking streets.    By James Wanzala | 9 hours ago By Ishaq Jumbe | 14 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 21 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 1 day ago
