Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi during a past interview with The Standard in Nairobi [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  Many residents of Laikipia County have been travelling to other counties to get health services.  This is due to the congestion at the two main hospitals, Nyahururu and Nanyuki.  It was particularly hard during the Covid-19 pandemic since the two hospitals did not have an oxygen plant.  Patients had to be taken to Nyeri, Nakuru and even Nairobi counties. But now, the county government has put up a Sh20 million oxygen plant at the Nyahururu Referral Hospital.  It has also built a 120-bed ward at the facility, while the Nanyuki County Referral Hospital has a new 126-bed ward.  According to Governor Ndiritu Muriithi, the project has cost his administration close to Sh80 million.  “There is no way a county can develop when its people are unhealthy. That is why we found it wise to allocate these funds to the two hospitals,” he said.  More than 15 dispensaries across the counties have also been upgraded to health centres.  “Enough health personnel have been deployed in these hospitals so that we avoid congestion at the two referral hospitals like has been happening. It’s a new beginning for this sector,” said the governor.  This financial year, the county has procured drugs worth more than Sh200 million.  “Residents can now get drugs as recommended from their nearest health centres. The drugs have already been distributed,” he said.  The governor encourage residents to register with the NHIF for cheaper treatment.     By Stephen Rutto | 3 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 3 hours ago By Titus Too | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago
