The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro) escaped auctioneer's hammer after the Labour Court stopped former employees from selling its assets over Sh11 million debt.  The 50 employees who were rendered redundant, through their Kenya Scientific Research International Technical and Institutions Workers Union, had obtained orders to sell the property as the organisation delayed to pay them for unlawful sacking.  “I give extension of time to deposit the Sh11,087,358 and Kalro is deemed to have fully complied with the court orders given on July 1, 2021,” said Justice Christine Baari of the Kisumu Labour Court on Thursday.  Justice Baari said Kalro had given sufficient explanation for the delay, which looked beyond its control. When Kalro was served by auctioneers at its western Kenya-based Sugar Research Institute where the 50 employees worked, it rushed to court to stop the proclamation notice served to it by Intime Auctioneers on September 21, last year.
