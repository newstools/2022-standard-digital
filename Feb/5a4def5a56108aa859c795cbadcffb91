The suspects were, subsequently, positively identified through a parade, leading to their arrests. [Courtesy]  Four officers of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have been arrested on allegations of robbery with violence.  The suspects are attached to Lang’ata station in Nairobi.   The four were arrested on Friday, February 11 after allegedly abducting and robbing a man of Sh312,700 last week.  The DCI said in a statement on Twitter that the suspects waylaid their suspect at NextGen Mall on Mombasa Road at noon on February 6. Their alleged victim was waiting for a taxi, when the four abducted him.  “He (victim) was forcefully bundled into a waiting vehicle belonging to the four detectives,” the DCI said.  Police say one of the four robbery with violence suspects transferred to his phone Sh40,000 from the victim’s mobile money wallet.  The suspects, thereafter, went to the victim’s apartment, where they allegedly took another Sh272,700, which was in US Dollar denomination – $2,400.  They, thereafter, drove with him to Choma Zone on Mombasa Road and abandoned him on the roadside. The incident lasted two hours, police said.  The victim went to report the incident at Akila Police Station in South C but was surprised to see the vehicle used in his abduction parked at the station.  The victim, thereafter, changed the plan and went and filed his report at the DCI headquarters on Kiambu Road.  The suspects were, subsequently, positively identified through a parade, leading to their arrests.  The four are expected to be charged with robbery with violence early next week.  “The Directorate of Criminal Investigations condemns the unfortunate behaviour of the four suspects in the strongest possible terms. Their actions are isolated indiscipline cases that do not represent our moral values and what we stand for,” the DCI said on Twitter.
