The world is watching with shock as tensions continue to rise between Russia, the United States and Nato over Ukraine.  Russia has amassed 130,000 troops near the Ukrainian border. However, the country, which fears that Ukraine might join Nato, denies it is planning to attack Ukraine. But the claim is not convincing considering that in 2014, Moscow invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.  At the time, the international community did not do enough to deter the act of aggression.  But the threat is not being taken lightly now. Ukraine and Nato are also mobilising troops in case of an another invasion. US President Joe Biden has already approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to eastern Europe. Nato defence ministers are expected to discuss further reinforcements during their meeting on February 16.  The US, European Union and United Kingdom have threatened Russia with massive sanctions should it invade Ukraine, with some US officials being quoted saying Russia could invade Ukraine any time. When tensions rise between two nuclear superpowers, the world can only shudder. At a time when the world is fighting a stubborn pandemic, this standoff is an unnecessary distraction.  The brinkmanship exhibited by both sides in the conflict is only fanning the fire.  We call on the parties involved to take advantage of the diplomatic efforts launched by France President Emmanuel Macron to defuse tensions and reach a diplomatic solution. This will prevent loss of life and property through a war that could have been averted.  We can only hope that both sides will be be level-headed enough not to escalate the simmering conflict. They should seek a diplomatic solution.  US and Russia are among the world’s most powerful countries. They should display their might, not by turning guns against each other, but by helping poor nations to deal with Covid-19.
