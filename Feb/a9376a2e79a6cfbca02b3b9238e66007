The judge said the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  A man found guilty of defiling and killing a nursery school pupil nine years ago has been jailed for 20 years.  Isaak Mwangi Wakanyi, 46, was handed the sentence by Justice Kanyi Kimondo.  The judge said the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.  “The accused assaulted and strangled an innocent five-year-old girl for his own gratification thus he must bear the consequence. I sentence him to serve 20 years in prison,” ruled the judge. The judge said the sentence runs from September 6, 2013, when he was placed in custody.  During the trial, the witnesses told the court how the minor (FNN) was abducted by the accused while on her way home from the nursery school in Kamahuha, Maragua at around 3pm on September 5, 2013.  Witnesses told the court that her body was found the next morning by pupils from the nearby primary schools who found it dumped near the earth road.  The girls father told the court how on the material day he waited for the child until 4pm before embarking on a search with friends without success.  “The next morning, I received a call to go towards Kaha-ini market. I found her naked body, with an injury on the forehead. The accused person was at the scene and quietly sneaked away and surrendered to the chief,” he recounted.  Elder Zewaro Wainaina said he was at Makuyu chief's office when he saw the accused run in and asked he be arrested after confessing to have killed someone.   By Boniface Gikandi | 3 hours ago By Phares Mutembei | 12 hours ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 4 days ago By Jane Mugambi | 4 days ago
