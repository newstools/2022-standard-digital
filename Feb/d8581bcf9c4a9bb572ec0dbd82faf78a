The fire started at around 3 pm. [Eric Abuga, Standard]  Property of unestablished value has been destroyed after a fire started in Kisii town Central Business District this afternoon.  However, no casualty has been reported.  Standard reporter on-site says the fire broke at around 3:15 pm and had consumed about 15 stalls minutes later, including three midsize hotels.  As of 4 pm, no firefighters or police officers had got to the scene. The cause of the fire remains unknown although Juakali artisans in the area suspect that an LPG gas cylinder from one of the stalls exploded.  Several stalls including 3 mid-size hotels were consumed in the fire. [Eric Abuga, Standard]  Due to malfunctioning firefighting equipment in the county fire station, authorities had to call for rescue from the neighbouring Nyamira County.  This comes barely a week since a truck ferrying LPG gas exploded at Mutarakwa on Nairobi-Limuru road. No casualties were reported.     By Olivia Odhiambo | 25 minutes ago By James Omoro | 3 hours ago By Isaiah Gwengi and Olivia odhiambo | 17 hours ago By Robert Amalemba | 1 day ago
