The Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) have agreed to cooperate in fighting misuse of public resources.  The agencies signed a memorandum of understanding to share information and build capacity to ensure prudent use of public resources.  SRC CEO Anne Gitau said they would come up with long-term preventive mechanisms to stop wastage of public resources.  ‘‘We are also looking at ensuring there is capacity building within the two institutions and across the public service when it comes to ethics and collaboration in ensuring there is reduced wastage in public service,’’ she said.  EACC CEO Twalib Mbarak said they would share critical information on matters to do with leadership and integrity. ‘‘We are looking at SRC in the course of our mandate when we take people to court. It can support us in provision of witnesses, be it physical evidence or for them to appear in court to support what we will be doing,’’ he said.
