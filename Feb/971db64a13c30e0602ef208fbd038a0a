Deputy President William Ruto has labeled Raila Odinga as a project of people who are self-seekers and want to protect their interests.  Ruto claimed that the people who are backing Raila's bid for State House were out to create the impression that the battle for the presidency was between him (DP) and President Uhuru Kenyatta.    Speaking at Thimangiri in Meru county yesterday, the DP said this is a wider scheme to set up him against President Kenyatta.   "He is a project who wants to be supported by people who have their own interests. He is a project and a puppet by people who want to continue governing the country without the blessing of Kenyans," he said. Ruto who was accompanied by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford-Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and other leaders said Kenya Kwanza was determined to win the elections and steer development in the country.  He told residents not to support a president who is being imposed on them.  "There are those trying to create the impression that the competition is between me and this group against President Kenyatta. We voted for him in 2013, 2017 and even in the repeat poll. We know the President is retiring in August. The competition is between us and Raila," Ruto said.  The DP told Raila to leave the President alone and face his competitors. "You should come and compete with us and leave the president alone," he said and urged residents to vote for UDA MPs and MCAs in the polls.  Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki said Raila's dalliance with President Kenyatta will not guarantee him victory against Ruto.   By Patrick Beja | 5 hours ago By Ndungu Gachane | 5 hours ago By Willis Oketch | 13 hours ago By Phares Mutembei | 13 hours ago
