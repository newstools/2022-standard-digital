Doctors have raised the red flag on boys born with genital disorder in Laikipia and Nyandarua counties.  Last month, many boys born in the two counties had undescended testis, a condition medically known as cryptorchidism. Nyahururu County alone recorded 24 cases in January alone.  According to an urologist, this condition occurs as a result of premature birth, but he also acknowledges there are other unknown factors which scientists are working to establish.  Given the proximity of the counties to each other and this new problem, deeper investigations should be undertaken to establish if at all other factors, other than medical, are responsible for this occurrence. This is necessary in ensuring that no more cryptorchidism cases are reported in the counties. Prevention, as often said, is better than cure.
