IEBC acting CEO Hussein Marjan before Public Accounts Committee (PAC), February 28, 2022. [David Njaaga, Standard]  The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has shortlisted five candidates for the position of Chief Executive Officer, among them acting CEO Hussein Marjan.  The five were selected from some 511 applicants.  Additionally, 10 individuals were shortlisted from 860 applicants for the position of deputy CEO. Interviews for both positions are scheduled for March 8, 2022.  Others who have been shortlisted are Mombasa County IEBC Election Manager Nancy Kariuki, Electoral and Governance Expert Zephania Aura, George Michugu and Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development Corporate Services Director Joel Mabonga. Communications Authority of Kenya Director General Ezra Chiloba. [Courtesy, Standard]  The position fell vacant in 2018 after the commission fired Ezra Chiloba over failure to appear, on two occasions, before IEBC’s disciplinary committee.  Chiloba had been suspended to pave way for audit of procurement of election materials, a move occasioned by the resignation of three commissioners vice chairperson Connie Maina, Dr Paul Kurgat and Margaret Mwachanya.  In their resignation they cited “having no faith in Chairman Wafula Chebukati and his leadership.”  With the positions of the four commissioners who quit in 2017 and 2018 having been filled last year, IEBC is almost fully constituted to efficiently carry through the August 9 elections.   By Caroline Chebet | 5 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 5 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 5 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo | 5 hours ago
