[Elvis Ogina, Standard]  Jubilee Party’s much anticipated National Governing Council (NGC) is currently underway at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi.    Delegates at the NGC are expected to review the party’s policies, ratify proposed changes to the party’s Constitution and consider its rebranded seal, symbol and flag – Jubilee’s last ties to Deputy President William Ruto, who has since moved on to form the United Democratic Alliance (UDA).

According to Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe, after the Jubilee and ODM NGC meetings, the parties will hold a joint session where President Uhuru will formally endorse Odinga’s presidential bid.
