Justice Teresia Matheka gave the parties 10 days to file the consent in court. [Courtesy]  The High Court has allowed negotiations between a couple in a succession case of former Nakuru businessman Harilal Velji.  Nikunj Shah, Velji's son, went to court to stop his wife Trishna Shah from benefiting from the property her father-in-law left behind when he died without a will on March 30, 2019, aged 78.  Yesterday Justice Teresia Matheka allowed Nikunj’s lawyer Daniel Kisilah and Trishna’s lawyer Emmanuel Koskei to hold a discussion and sign a consent.  Matheka gave the parties 10 days to file the consent in court. The court heard that the parties were in the final stages of agreeing to a consent that will see Trishna have a share of her father-in-law's property.  Trishna wants not only a share of the property but also Sh10 million she claims she was gifted by her father-in-law before he died.  She claims Velji called for a family meeting before he died and gifted her the Sh10 million which was deposited in Prime Bank.  On his part, Nikunj claims he and his sister Anjali Shah are the beneficiaries of the estate. The case will be mentioned on February 24 for consent recording.   By The Conversation and Reuters | 10 hours ago By Jacob Ngetich  | 10 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 10 hours ago By  Kamau Muthoni | 10 hours ago
