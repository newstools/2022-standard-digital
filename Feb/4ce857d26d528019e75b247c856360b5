Families affected by insecurity at Kaakong’u in Turkana South wait for food aid. [Mike Ekutan, Standard]  More than 2,000 people have left their homes in Turkana South following a resurgence of banditry attacks along Turkana, Baringo and West Pokot borders.  Rebecca Loruan, 34, a resident of Kaakong’u area, told The Standard that her livestock was stolen by raiders at Kaakong’u area last week.  Ms Loruan says she is helpless. “I don’t know where to start because the little I had has been stolen by bandits,” Loruan said.  She called on the government to improve security in the area, saying women are the most affected.   Reuben Erupe, 32, blamed security personnel for their late response to attacks.  Transport from Lokori in Turkana East to Kapedo through Kamuge and Lomelo has been paralysed. A boda boda rider was killed on that route while on his way to Lokori.  Turkana County Police Commander Samwel Ndanyi said they had initiated patrols along the Lous-Kainuk stretch to curb insecurity.  “I want to confirm to motorists along that stretch that security has been beefed up. The is no need to panic,” Ndanyi said.  The Turkana County government is now distributing food, animal feeds and water to affected populations.  The County team, led by Charles Lokiyoto who is in charge of the county disaster management, confirmed that they will prove water through a tracking system for one month.  “We have come to the rescue of the suffering families. We have talked with them about the challenges. We have brought maize, beans, cooking oil and other services,” said Lokiyoto.  Lokiyoto said his ministry had partnered with the Ministry of Health in Turkana to provide medical services to the migrating population.     By Lynn Kolongei | 2 hours ago By Phares Mutembei | 2 hours ago By Caroline Chebet | 2 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 9 hours ago
