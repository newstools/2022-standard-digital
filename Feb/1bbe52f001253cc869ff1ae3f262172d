EALA MP Florence Jematia when she appeared before an open-air court at the Kabarnet Law Courts on February 3, 2022. [Harun Wathari, Standard]  East Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA) Member of Parliament Florence Jematia has been released on bond after spending two days in a police cell.  The court, however, banned Jematia from attending any political rally or setting foot in Baringo South pending police investigations.  The lawmaker was also directed to report to the local DCI office every day, from February 7 to 11, according to a ruling by Senior Residents Magistrate Nerolyne Idagwa.  Jematia was apprehended in Nairobi, on Wednesday for alleged incitement remarks she made at Lomoiywet in Baringo South in January. The embattled lawmaker was arraigned in an open-air court at the Kabarnet Law Courts on Thursday.  Prosecutor George Mongare had asked the court to issue custodial orders to allow police to detain Jematia as they conclude investigations into the matter.  But Jematia was captured on a video clip asking residents of Mochongoi in Baringo South Constituency, to raise funds to purchase firearms.  “We want a PayBill number. We want to buy guns for every household in Mochongoi all the way to Baringo North...If you own a motorbike then you can purchase a gun,” she was captured saying.  On Friday Jematia who was represented by Frank Boiywo, Tunen Kiplagat, Kipkemboi Sirma and Allan Ochieng, was released on one million bond with a surety of a similar amount.  On January 4, bandits attacked Yatia in the same sub-county, killing herder Vincent Tuwit, 24.  On December 11 last year, AP officer David Omondi was shot dead in Chepkesin, Baringo North. He was with his colleagues on a routine security patrol.  By Irissheel Shanzu | 1 hour ago By Antony Gitonga | 1 hour ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 9 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 15 hours ago
