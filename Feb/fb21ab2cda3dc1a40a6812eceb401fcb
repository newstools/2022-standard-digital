Despite the mandatory testing suspension, the ministry maintains that all incoming and exiting travellers must be tested 72 hours before boarding a plane.  “Our health workers will continue to screen all travellers both at arrival and departure and verify their Covid-19 test certificates,”  By Elvince Joshua | 2 hours ago By Patrick Vidija | 4 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 6 hours ago By Reuters | 7 hours ago
