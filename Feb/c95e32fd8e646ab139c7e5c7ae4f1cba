Ann Ngirita in court during the hearing of the NYS case. [George Njunge, standard]  A Nairobi based anti-corruption court has ordered Ann Ngirita to be placed in custody.  This is after her surety in the Sh468m NYS graft case was withdrawn. The surety withdrew the Sh500,000 security that he had deposited in the case.  Magistrate Eunice Kagure directed that Ngirita remains in custody at Lang'ata Women Prison until she finds a replacement.   Kagure said surety is a voluntary act and the Court lacks the power to force anyone to continue acting as a surety.  Ngirita together with her mother, two sisters, former PS Lilian Omollo and other former employees of NYS had appeared in court for the hearing of the graft case.  Ngirita was arrested and charged with receiving Sh60 million from the National Youth Service for supplying ‘nothing’.  The hearing of the case is currently underway with a witness producing payment vouchers of Sh4 million.  In August 2020, the High Court in Nairobi ordered that some of the properties belonging to Ngirita, and those of her mother, sister and brother be forfeited to the State.  The four are accused of collectively acquiring more than Sh300 million from the NYS kitty.  This comes weeks after Ngirita declared her interest to contest for the Nakuru Woman Representative position in the forthcoming general election.  Ngirita made the announcement after joining the ruling Jubilee party where she was welcomed by party officials in Nakuru.  The party however later rejected her bid with links to the ghosts of the scandal.  Her entry into politics sparked reactions forcing the party to issue conflicting reports.  The surety withdrawal may affect Ngirita's political ambitions if she does not get an alternative.   By Pkemoi Ngenoh | 3 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 16 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 1 day ago By Stephanie Wangari | 2 days ago
