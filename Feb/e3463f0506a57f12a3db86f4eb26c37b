The farmers will produce feeds for their livestock and sell the surplus to others who are not members of the groups.   Governor Anne Waiguru says by producing quality feeds, the farmers will improve their animals’ nutrition which will in turn increase milk production.  “Some 37 groups will each receive one feed mixer and one single phase motor while 11 others will each get two motorised grass cutters and one chopper. Eighteen groups will each receive two manual hay balers and two motorised grass cutters,” she said.       By Phares Mutembei | 25 minutes ago By Muriithi Mugo | 6 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 1 day ago By Jane Mugambi | 1 day ago
