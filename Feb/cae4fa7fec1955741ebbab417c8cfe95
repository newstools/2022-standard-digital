Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders Deputy President William Ruto,ANC Party leader Musalia Mudavadi [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  The ANC party has lashed out at Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua over remarks that the Kenya Kwanza coalition will front a running mate from the Mt Kenya region.  Appearing on a morning television program, Rigathi said that as far as he is concerned, there is a general consensus that William Ruto is the candidate for UDA  “While the running mate will come from the mountain at the appropriate time as it was discussed," said Rigathi during an interview on Citizen TV on Monday.  But a statement signed by ANC Secretary-General Simon Gikuru dismissed the claims saying the coalition was yet to decide who its presidential flag bearer and running mate would be. "Gachagua should transition from regional UDA [party] mindset to embrace the broader picture of Kenya Kwanza philosophy," reads the statement in part.  Gikuru added Kenya Kwanza flag bearers will be unveiled at an appropriate time by the coalition principals.  "Rigathi Gachagua has no authority to speak for Kenya Kwanza on the matter hence his sentiments are premature, untimely and unwarranted," Gikuru concluded.  Kenya Kwanza was born after ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi invited Ruto’s team to ANC’s National Delegates Convention that was also attended by Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula.  The team later joined forces with Ruto's UDA team to form the new Alliance.  Though there has been speculation, the respective principals are yet to disclose details of the agreement that put them together.  "The details of the cooperation between UDA, ANC and Ford Kenya, and any other political party if at all will formally be unveiled by the principals at an appropriate time," UDA Secretary-General Veronica Maina previously said.
