Chief Justice Martha Koome waters a tree she planted at the Eldoret law courts on Monday. [Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  Chief Justice Martha Koome has commissioned a small claims court in Eldoret to help in expeditious determination of commercial disputes valued below Sh1 million.   Eldoret now joins Kajiado, Kakamega, Kisumu, Machakos, Makueni, Nakuru, Meru and Mombasa, whose small claims courts were gazetted and announced by the CJ on December 10.  The court is expected to reduce backlog and congestion of courts while ensuring quick dispensation of justice, within 60 days, according to the CJ.  She said it would also help achieve and enhance the objectives of the Alternative Justice System.  “I call upon judges in high courts to transfer commercial matters and even accident matters whose claims are below Sh1 million to the small claims courts,” she said.    Eldoret Principal Judge Reuben Nyakundi said the court, established under Small claims Act of 2016, will serve Uasin Gishu and its environs.  Such courts determine civil claims relating to contracts for sale and supply of goods and services, money held and received, set offs and counter-claims on contractual claims, liability in offenses involving damage and compensation for personal injuries.     By Stephen Rutto | 3 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 3 hours ago By Titus Too | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago
