[Elvis Ogina, Standard]  The One Kenya Alliance (OKA) has begun the process of forming a grand coalition with Jubilee and ODM parties, to form the Azimio-One Kenya Alliance.  OKA principals led by Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka said they reached the agreement after holding open discussions with the two parties.  “As OKA, we firmly believe in an open, honest, and structured dialogue whose basis is the promotion of national unity; upholding and respecting the dignity of all Kenyans,” Kalonzo said.  The four principals; Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Gideon Moi (Kanu), Martha Karua (Narc-K) and UDP’s Cyrus Jirongo will on Monday, February 28 sign the Coalition Agreement and thereafter deposit it with the Registrar of Political Parties. OKA also hinted at unveiling its presidential candidate, saying this new development is a win for partnership.  “There is nobody swallowing OKA…we stress equality of partnership. It is good for Kenya and we are rearing to go,” the former vice president noted.  The move comes amid speculation that OKA would be joining forces with the Azimio la Umoja movement.  Last week, the Wiper leader heaped praises on Raila and his OKA colleagues, saying they are not driven by personal greed. “This time we will win first round and that is why we are talking,” he said.  This now sets the stage for a bruising battle with the Kenya Kwanza alliance of Deputy President William Ruto, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetangula.   In the last two elections, Raila and Kalonzo ran on a joint ticket.
