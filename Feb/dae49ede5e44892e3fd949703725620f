Council of Governors (COG) Chairman Martin Wambora now wants the National Treasury to disburse the delayed funds so that counties can undertake their functions. [File, Standard]  The Council of Governors (CoG) has written to Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani seeking the disbursement of Sh72.7 billion, citing a cash crisis in the counties.  The monies were to be used to run county operations in the months of December 2021, January 2022 and February 2022.  In their letter to the minister, CoG chairperson Martin Wambora said MPs’ failure to pass the County Government Grants Bill 2021 has led to operations halt in the counties.  Governors say they are not in a position to offset pending bills and complete ongoing projects due to the funds deficit. “The delay in disbursement of equitable shares, and the delay by Parliament to pass the County Government Grants Bill, 2021 further hampers counties’ capacity to deliver services and complete projects,” said Wambora in the letter dated Thursday, February 10.  The CoG chairperson said 16 counties are owed Sh10.4 billion by the National Treasury, funds for the month of December.  Forty-six (46) counties are in need of Sh30.8 billion for the month of January, with only Mombasa County being the recipient of January funds.  All the 47 counties are yet to receive a total of Sh31.5 billion for February disbursement.  In total, the National Government owes counties Sh72.7 billion, Wambora said.
