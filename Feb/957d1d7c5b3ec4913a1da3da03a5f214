Sarah Okech cleans her flooded house in Kitale town. [Martin Ndiema, Standard]  At least five families in Bidii estate, Kitale town, were last night displaced by waste water following heavy rains.  Tenants in the residential area behind Westfield Motors expressed concern over poor drainage system.  Stella Wamboi said the water washed away some of the family’s property, including his son’s books and shoes.  “We have been exposed to this sewage for a very long time. Other than the dirty run-off, traders dump their waste just at our doorstep,” she said, adding that they had to leave the house after their efforts to keep the waste water away failed.   “We fear that we might contract waterborne diseases,” she lamented.  Another neighbour, Sarah Okech, claimed that when they sought help, the county government only issued letters warning against illegal dumping, which tenants in the area were asked to forward to nearby restaurants and kiosks.  Stephen Wanyonyi asked the relevant departments to visit the area and get a lasting solution.  As the rainy season sets in, the public has raised concern over safety in areas prone to flooding and lightening. They want the government to open up drainage system besides installing lightning arresters.     By Stephen Rutto | 3 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 3 hours ago By Titus Too | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago
