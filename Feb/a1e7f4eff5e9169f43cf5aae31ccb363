[Peterson Githaiga, Standard]  A Sh100m bridge across River Orkeriai launched last week by Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole Lenku collapsed on Wednesday after heavy rains pounded the area.    The bridge was meant to link central, eastern and southern Kajiado.  The bridge was opened by Kajiado Governor Ole Lenku.
