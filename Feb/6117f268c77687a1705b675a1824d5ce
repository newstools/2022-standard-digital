According to the founder, Mary Ann Kariuki, inmates will be issued with certificates at the end of the course.  "We are here to empower these women with skills that will help them get jobs when they leave here," said Kariuki.          By Mireri Junior | 2 days ago By Muriithi Mugo | 4 days ago By Muriithi Mugo | 5 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 6 days ago
