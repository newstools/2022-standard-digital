A vehicle being towed from accident scene [Courtesy]  Four people died this morning after their Nissan SUV hit a railway bridge wall in Dagoretti along Ngong Road in Nairobi.  The four, including two Canadians, were headed to the Nairobi Central Business District from Karen.  Lang'ata OCPD Benjamin Mwanthi told The Standard that three other passengers were injured and rushed to Coptic Hospital.  Of the three, one has been treated and discharged. Two others are still receiving treatment at the facility and one is in critical condition at the High Dependency Unit (HDU). Motorists faulted the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) for not installing lights and placing road signs between Junction Mall to Lenana.   They called upon the authority to take action so that such accidents can be avoided.  The accident comes a month after Dr Duncan Kibogong, the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) Deputy Director for Road safety Programmes, said the number of road accidents had increased in January.  Kibogong attributed the rise in accidents to increased numbers of vehicles on the roads.
