A scene of the accident. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  Three people have been rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital after they were injured in an early morning accident within Nairobi’s CBD.  The three, all women sustained injuries on their hands and legs after their car collided with a matatu at the junction of Kenyatta Avenue and Muindi Mbingu Street.  A traffic officer at the scene blamed the accident on the driver of the NNK Shuttle Sacco driver who refused to give way to the private car.  The driver of the matatu which plies the Kikuyu-Westlands and City centre route was speeding from Kenyatta street before it hit the salon car which was heading towards the city market. The impact of the collision saw the private car overturn.  All the occupants were safely removed through the window.  "We rescued three women from the vehicle who were seriously injured and have been rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital. Other passengers in the ill-fated matatu were slightly injured," said the traffic officer.  In the recent past, the junctions between Kenyatta avenue, Muindi Mbingu and Koinange streets have been witnessing accidents in the morning due to failure by drivers to observe traffic lights.  Police through Nairobi Traffic Police Commandant Joshua Omukata called on motorists to be cautious when driving especially in the early hours of the morning in the city.
