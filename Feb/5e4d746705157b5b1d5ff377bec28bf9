People pay their loans at the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) offices at the Anniversary Towers on Thursday, June 6. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  More than 75,000 freshers who joined universities in September 2021 are yet to get loans from Helb.  The Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) claims it is unable to make cash available to students since Treasury has not released the funds. Additionally, Helb blames loan defaulters for its financial woes.  Apparently, the effects of Covid-19 have made it impossible for at least 100,000 loanees to service their loans. Majority of students depend on Helb for rent and upkeep. As fate would have it, most of them come from humble backgrounds and truly need help.  The government should put its house in order and save the students this unnecessary agony. Sending students to colleges and universities without facilitation for their accommodation and sustenance defeats the purpose for which the government set up Helb.
