Omingo Magara. [Sammy Omingo, Standard]  UDA’s efforts to penetrate Gusii suffered a major blow yesterday following the resignation of the party’s national treasurer Omingo Magara.  The veteran politician said he quit UDA after “considerable consultations” over his political future.  Speaking during a meeting with his supporters in Kisii Town yesterday, Magara said he had, for long, harboured ambitions of being governor and he could not achieve it through a party linked to Deputy President William Ruto.  Magara said the decision to quit the party was arrived at following consultations with national leaders, Kisii residents and his family, and that he would continue engaging with various political politicians whose vision align with his. “As you can imagine this is a difficult decision to make but we must allow the voice of the people we lead to prevail above our personal ambitions. Since that voice seems to be wanting a different direction than the one I was taking, I have decided to change course,” said Magara.  The former South Mugirango MP has been a close ally of Ruto. In 2006, they were attacked by youths at Nyamarambe stadium for attending former Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae’s event without invitation.   By Antony Gitonga | 2 hours ago By Brian Okoth | 4 hours ago By Patrick Vidija | 7 hours ago By Jacob Ngetich  | 12 hours ago
