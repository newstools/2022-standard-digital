A young boy fishing on a Raft in Lake Turkana [File]  Kenya is expected to submit an updated report on the state of conservation of Lake Turkana National parks to the World Heritage Committee.  Sibiloi, South Island and Central Island parks, which cover 161,485ha, have been listed among 52 endangered World Heritage sites since 2018.   “Potential irreversible loss of the property’s outstanding universal values is caused by impacts of various development projects on the Omo River (Kuraz irrigation project, Gibe III dam) on water and nutrient flow into Lake Turkana,” a report from the World Heritage Committee stated.  In 2021 the committee expressed deep regrets about continued lack of a consolidated response by Kenya and Ethiopia. In a past recommendation, Ethiopia was mandated to give an update on planned and current development projects in the Turkana basin, and submit Environmental Impact Assessment for the Kuraz Sugar Development Project for review by the World Heritage Centre and advisory bodies. The List of World Heritage sites in danger is designed by UNESCO to inform and encourage corrective action.
