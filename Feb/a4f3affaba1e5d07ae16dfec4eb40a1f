George Kiremi at a Mombasa Court in Mombasa County on Monday, February 14, 2022. [Kelvin Karani, Standard]  A terror suspect is said to have been planning to join jihadists in the Democratic Republic of Congo after training in Somalia.   The Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) says George Kiremi was in constant communication with his accomplices to plan his travel to Somalia to join the outlawed terror group Al Shabaab.  The prosecution is asking the court not to release on bond.  Kiremi has denied being a member of the terror group.   The ATPU claims Kiremi, who holds a Kenyan passport, once traveled to the United Arab Emirates to work as a cleaner but was deported back.  “We are also pursuing investigations into terror-related activities outside the country and there is a very high likelihood that if released on bond the accused will interfere with the possible links and witnesses with a view to defeating or obstructing the investigations,” states the ATPU in an affidavit.  Further, the ATPU told the court that the accused would interfere with the prosecution witnesses.  The police argue that it is in the interest of justice, good order, public safety and security that Kiremi be denied bond pending the hearing of the case.  “The accused person has major links in the outlawed terrorism group, Al Shabaab militia in Somalia. His fixed abode and social or community ties are yet to be established and his release could prejudice the prosecution’s case,” the police say.  The accused claims he does not know how to read, but the court told him he will get help from a paralegal group in the remand.  The matter will be mentioned on Monday.   By Joackim Bwana | 3 days ago By Joackim Bwana | 3 days ago By Standard Reporter | 4 days ago By Marion Kithi | 4 days ago
