Some of the Mumias Sugar Company's cane crushing machines rotting away. [Nathan Ochunge, Standard]  The High Court in Kakamega on Friday reversed orders it had issued to the County Government of Kakamega on February 18 that had allowed Sarrai Group to continue with reviving the cash-strapped Mumias Sugar company.  The orders were stayed by Justice William Musyoka after farmers protested saying they (orders) conflicted with others given by Justice Wilfrida Okwany of Nairobi.  “To avoid the conflict, the orders made first in time (Nairobi January 14, 2022) takes precedence over the latter orders (Kakamega February 18, 2022). The Kakamega orders shall therefore be stayed pending hearing and determination of the motion dated February 21 or pending other orders in the Nairobi case,” said Musyoka.  In their filing seeking to be enjoined in the Kakamega case against the county, the farmers summitted that the County of Kakamega was part of a conspiracy to defeat justice against them and other stakeholders of the factory. “To further demonstrate this conspiracy and an attempt to bring disrepute in the administration of justice, the county failed to inform the High Court in Nairobi orders by Justice Wilfrida Okwany,” they said.
