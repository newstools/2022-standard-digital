[Sammy Omingo, Standard]  Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya’s administration has started redevelopment of six estates in Kakamega and Mumias towns, as it seeks to put up 1,400 rent or buy affordable housing units at a cost of Sh6 billion.  The estates include Amalemba, Otiende, Mudiri, Old Airport, and Lubao estates in Kakamega town and Mjini estate in Mumias town.  According to Shem Tai, whose Pinnie Agency Limited company was awarded the tender to develop the estates, construction works will begin early next month.  He said Mudiri estate will be the first one to be redeveloped.  The county government issued a notice to the residents of the affected estates to vacate their houses about six months ago in order to pave way for the project. Most of the houses earmarked for demolition used to belong to defunct local government authorities.  Mr Tai said they plan to construct at least 1,400 modern houses in phase one of the project and an additional 2,600 units will be constructed in the second phase.  The estates will have Studio Apartments, one-bedroom units, two-bedroom units, three-bedroom, and four-bedroom units, according to the developer.  Tai disclosed that the project also includes a shopping mall, ECD Centre, and a health facility in some of the estates.  Governor Oparanya had earlier indicated that county staff will be given the first priority followed by civil servants.  The county chief indicated that the project will be completed in nine months. He said occupants of the houses earmarked for demolition will be given preference.  Oparanya said the houses will be sold to both county and national government staff at competitive rates.    By Kennedy Gachuhi | 1 hour ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 2 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 2 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 2 hours ago
