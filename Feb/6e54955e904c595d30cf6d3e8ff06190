[Antony Gitonga, Standard]  A post-mortem examination of a slain Naivasha fish trader shows he died of excessive bleeding after he was shot five times at close range.  The autopsy conducted by government pathologist Titus Ngulungu indicated that Simon Thuku, 35, died from "massive blood loss".  This came as the family planned his burial at his rural home in Ndondori in Nakuru.  According to the pathologist's report, the victim was shot in the abdomen, with three of the bullets exiting.   “After the postmortem, I formed the view that the cause of death was massive blood loss on the abdominal body organs caused by multiple gunshot wounds,” says the report.  A representative of the Independent Medico Legal Unit Karobia Kiraitu said they were ready for the case.  “The late Thuku has been laid to rest and all that we are now seeking is justice for the family,” he said.  The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has taken over the case, with two of the officers involved suspended and senior officers from the Naivasha team reshuffled.  Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo noted that it was high time the coast guards left the lake.     By Stephen Rutto | 3 hours ago By Titus Too | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 3 hours ago
