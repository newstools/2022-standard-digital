Deputy President William Ruto when he welcomed Nyandarua Senator Mwangi Githiomi to UDA on February 25, 2022. [Twitter/UDA]  Deputy President William Ruto today welcomed Nyandarua Senator Mwangi Githiomi to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party.  Githiomi was elected senator on a Jubilee Party ticket during the 2017 General Election.  He previously served as the Planning Executive in Nyandarua County before joining the Senate where he is the Chairman of the Committee on Lands, Environment and Natural Resources.  On hand to receive the senator at the DP’s Karen residence was Ruto, senators Irungu Kang'ata (Murang'a) Kithure Kindiki (Tharaka Nithi), MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) and Kimani Ichung'wa (Kikuyu) and Charles Njagua (Starehe). “Growing bigger and better. Welcoming Nyandarua Senator Hon. Mwangi Githiomi to the Hustler Nation,” Ruto tweeted.  Githiomi becomes the latest politician to have ditched Jubilee and switched allegiance to Ruto ahead of the August 9 elections.  The defection came hours ahead of Ruto’s planned tour of Nyandarua County where he will make stopovers at Karangatha in Kinangop Constituency before heading to Geta in Kipipiri Constituency.  He is also scheduled to hold rallies at Mirangi-ini in Olkalou Constituency and later at Ngano, Oljoorok Constituency.  The DP will close his Nyandarua tour with another rally at Mairo Inya village in Ndaragwa Constituency.     By Brian Otieno | 4 hours ago By Josphat Thiong’o and James Wanzala | 4 hours ago By Fred Kagonye | 7 hours ago By James Wanzala | 9 hours ago
