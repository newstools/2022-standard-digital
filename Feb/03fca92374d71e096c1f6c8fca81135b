Residents of Gilgil are trying to come to terms with an incident in which a middle-aged woman is said to have killed her three children before taking her own life.  The lifeless bodies were found locked in their house in Teachers B Estate a few meters from Kenyatta Barracks.  It's suspected the woman, a housewife, killed the boys aged 9,7 and 1 year two days ago. The neighbours called the police after they noticed a foul smell coming from her house.  Gilgil OCPD John Ondit confirmed the incident adding that police were called to the scene by neighbours.  "It looks like the woman used poison to kill the minors before taking her life using a rope," said the police boss. He said that the husband to the deceased was a KDF officer who was currently serving the country in Somalia.  "It's not clear what motivated the woman to do this but we have collected the bodies and taken them to the Gilgil sub-county hospital mortuary," he said on phone.  Last year, a woman killed her three children in Naivasha in what she claimed to be a directive from powerful forces sent by her estranged husband.
