Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi has said ODM leader Raila Odinga is the only presidential candidate with an achievable plan for Kenya.  On Tuesday while addressing rallies in Eastlands, Nairobi, Mr Wanyonyi rallied residents behind Raila saying he has leadership qualities.  The MP who is eyeing the Nairobi governorship told residents at Friends Church in Donholm that the ODM leader is best suited to continue with development projects initiated by President Uhuru Kenyatta.    “Raila is our president in Azimio and this time round, we don’t want to gamble. We have to ensure that he is in State House,” he said. “Kenya has agreed that Baba is the fifth president of Kenya and in ODM, we have said that Nairobi is ours. Nairobi governor must be from ODM and the one who has offered himself is none other than Tim Wanyonyi,” he added.  Wanyonyi explained that Raila’s Babacare programme will go a long way in helping the public to access health care in the country.  He said single mothers, widows, widowers and orphans will also benefit from Sh6,000 monthly stipend.  Wanyonyi is the only candidate in ODM who has declared for Nairobi governor.  The MP is facing competition within Azimio la Umoja umbrella from Jubilee Party's Governor Anne Kananu, businesswoman Agnes Kagure and businessman Richard Ngatia.  Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, who is a member of Jubilee, has declared that he will vie for the coveted seat on ANC party ticket.  Wanyonyi said that the election is about economic transformation and not empty promises.
