Migori County Governor Okoth Obado [Denish Ochieng, Standard]  Contractors want Governor Okoth Obado’s administration to pay up the Sh700 million it owes them before he exits office.  They regretted not being paid despite completing work. Migori County Contractors Association Secretary-General Godness Oucho and chairman Peter Namasake said new projects should not be rolled out before they are paid.   “Paying us will reduce pending bills so that the new administration after the August 9 will start work on a clean balance sheet,” Oucho said.
