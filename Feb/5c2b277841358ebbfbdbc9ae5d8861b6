The footbridge under construction collapsed on Saturday, February 12, 2022. [Elvince Joshua, Standard]  A section of Lang’ata Road has been temporarily closed after a footbridge under construction collapsed early Saturday, February 12.  The footbridge is located near the Nyayo Stadium Roundabout.  It is unclear what caused the structure to collapse.  Motorists headed to Nairobi’s central business district from Ongata Rongai, Karen and Lang’ata estates were diverted to Bunyala Road. Those heading to the estates from the city centre were directed to use alternative routes through South C.  A crane and other equipment were, on Saturday afternoon, used to try and remove a section of the fallen bridge from the road.  One of the operators of this crane was reported to have died. [Elvince Joshua, Standard]  Engineers and police officers were at the scene as of the time of publishing this story.  A team was deployed to the scene to help clear the debris from the road.
