Motorists drive through security checkpoint at the main entrance of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi.  [Elvis Ogina,Standard]  Flights at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) were temporarily halted on Wednesday evening which affected all inbound and outbound planes at the busy airport.   Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), through a statement, explained that the temporary closure was caused by a problematic aircraft on the airport's runway.   Passengers were advised to check their respective airlines for flight status updates.    "This is to confirm that the runway at JKIA is temporarily closed as crews respond to safely remove a disabled aircraft. Takeoffs and landings are on hold," KAA said.  Reports indicate that the plane broke down at around 6 pm while taking off from the runway, causing some passengers to get stranded.   Speaking to The Standard on phone,  KCAA Director General Gilbert Kibe confirmed that the problem had been sorted and normal operations resumed.   "The runway has been cleared and operations have begun," Kibe said.
