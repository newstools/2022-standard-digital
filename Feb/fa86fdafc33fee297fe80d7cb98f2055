EALA MP Florence Jematia leaves Nairobi area police headquarters on Wednesday, February 2, 2022. She allegedly made inciting to remarks during a meeting at Mochongoi in Baringo County recently. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  East Africa Legislative Assembly (Eala) MP Florence Jematia has been charged with uttering words with subversive intention.  Resident Magistrate Vienna Amboko released Ms Jematia on a Sh500,000 bond after she denied the offense.  It is alleged that the MP uttered the words on January 30 at Lamaiwe Dispensary in Baringo South during a public prayer meeting.  The court heard that the words were intended to incite violence, crime and defiance to lawful authority. Prosecutor Judy Kitilit informed the court that she had supplied statements of five prosecution witnesses to the accused’s lawyers and that they intended to serve an additional statement at later date. Lawyer Tunen Kiplagat, who represented the MP, asked the court to release her on favourable cash bail terms. Kiplagat said the accused had obeyed court, and that her previous bond should be retained. “The accused person is a public figure and has no reason to run away from the jurisdiction of this court,” Kiplagat said. The case will be mentioned on March 21.    By Renee Were | 3 hours ago By Obare Osinde | 3 hours ago By James Wanzala | 3 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 3 hours ago
