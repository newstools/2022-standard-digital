The two institutions underscored the importance of undertaking at least one fire and safety drill annually to test preparedness.   “When we do these drills, we promote awareness to the occupants, members of the public, and even the responders," NDMU Chief Administration Officer Cyrus Maina said.  Maina added the drills were important to check whether the systems and mechanism are working.
