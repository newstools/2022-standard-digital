Tension is high in the Kainuk on the border of Turkana and West Pokot counties after one person was shot dead and another one critically injured by bandits who stole over 20 goats.  The two were grazing livestock near Kainuk river when they were attacked on Saturday.  The injured herder is recuperating at a local hospital.  Area chief Sarah Lochodo told The Standard that the local administration has convened meetings with peace committees from both sides from Turkana and West Pokot, to restore calm.  “What has happened will not stop us from preaching peace. We want the people to live peacefully,” she said.    Following the attack, angry residents barricaded the road between Kainuk and Kepenguria, disrupting transport between Lodwar to Kitale.  Former Mining CS John Munyes has called on the government to beef up security on the border of Turkana and West Pokot to address cattle rustling.  Speaking in Trans Nzoia, Munyes urged the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to reshuffle top security officers in the region even as the elections near.      By  Peterson Githaiga  | 1 day ago By Antony Gitonga | 2 days ago By Daniel Chege | 3 days ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 days ago
