Moses Osia, acting Water County Executive Committee member [Nathan Ochunge, Standard]  The county is drilling 25 boreholes in Malaba to cushion the locals from perennial water shortage.  The Sh40 million project, which targets 5,000 households, is also expected to improve sanitation in the border town and its environs.   “The community will get water from kiosks at subsidised cost. The boreholes will be ready in three months,” said Moses Osia, the acting Water CEC.  He said an additional Sh7 million will be used to install a storage tank at the Port Victoria Hospital, which has had poor water supply since its main pump broke down. Mr Osia said 12 wards have received Sh35 million through the Ward Development Fund, and Sh5 million from the governor to sink more boreholes.    These are Angurai North, Angurai South, Angurai East, Malaba South, Angorom, Chakol South, Chakol North, Amukura East, Nambale, Bukhayo East, Nambale Township and Marachi Central.  “Once complete, 36 per cent of the county will have access to clean water while 18 per cent will be connected to piped water,” he said.     By Bernard Lusigi | 4 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 1 day ago By Alexander Chagema | 3 days ago By Standard Team | 3 days ago
