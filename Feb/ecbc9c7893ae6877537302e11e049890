Ford Kenya has cracked the whip on rebel MCAs with Trans Nzoia minority leader Emmanuel Waswa being ousted and replaced.  Waswa among MCAs who decamped to the Democratic Action Party of Kenya, allied to Defense Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.  MCAs allied to Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula impeached Waswa and picked nominated MCA Margaret Wanjala to take his place.  Assembly Speaker Joshua Werunga confirmed the changes without details.  “It is true there have been changes. The minority leader has been removed and replaced, and the due procedure was followed,” he said.   Contacted for comment, Waswa dismissed his removal and described it as an inconsequential move.  “My removal is inconsequential and l don’t regret their action,” said Waswa.  His removal comes amid reports that his candidature for the Kwanza parliamentary seat is getting support from voters.  Waswa, a former close ally of Wetang’ula’s, is set to compete against the incumbent, Ferdinand Wanyonyi.
