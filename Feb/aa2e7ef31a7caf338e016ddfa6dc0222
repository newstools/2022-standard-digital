Kariandusi site in Gilgil, Nakuru County. [File]  History lovers convened at the Kariandusi Prehistoric site on Friday to launch the beginning of the rehabilitation of over 140 museums and prehistoric sites in Kenya.  The event, spearheaded by the National Museums of Kenya and partners, marked a much-needed intervention to preserve these African Early Stone Age sites, which are currently dilapidated.   Earlier last week, the National Museums and Wanderlust Diaries signed a memorandum of understanding to fundraise for the creation of awareness and rehabilitation of Kariandusi site.  Richard Kiara, an NMK representative said it is his desire to see Kenyans tour, appreciate and support the course of refurbishing the museums.   “The rehabilitation of Kariandusi is a noble idea. It is a step towards encouraging our local communities to embrace their culture and support local tourism,” said Kiara.  Wanderlust Diaries was among 12 platforms that won a grant from Meta, formerly Facebook, and will be partnering with rehabilitated female sex workers to provide tour experiences.  “People don’t grow up saying they want to be sex workers. Circumstances push them to do this, and they face a lot of abuse. We've partnered with several social welfare groups to equip them with the necessary life skills and offered them capital to start curio shops,” said Dr Amakove Wala, founder of Wanderlust Diaries.  “We want people to resonate with prehistoric tools and conditions so that they can appreciate these artifacts. We hope that when Kenyans get to the Kariandusi prehistoric site they get an experience that brings them back again.”      By Peter Muiruri | 35 minutes ago By Dominic Omondi | 35 minutes ago By Augustine Oduor | 35 minutes ago By Stephanie Wangari | 4 hours ago
