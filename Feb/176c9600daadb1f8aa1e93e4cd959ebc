Police in Mumias have launched investigations into the burning of a campaign billboard for a candidate vying for the governor seat.  Supporters of former Ketraco CEO Fernandes Barasa have cried foul after unknown people destroyed the billboard said to have cost Sh200, 000 in Mumias town.  Barasa, who is vying for the Kakamega County governor seat is believed to be a front runner in the race that has attracted seven other aspirants including former Senator Boni Khalwale and his successor Cleophas Malala.  Others are Lugari MP Ayub Savula, Kakamega Deputy Governor Philip Kutima, former Cabinet Minister Amukowa Anangwe, Nairobi based lawyer Michael Osundwa and Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito.  Barasa supporters claim the billboard was destroyed by his opponents in the gubernatorial race on Friday night. The billboard had been placed strategically near St Mary Mission Hospital Mumias barely 1.5km from Mumias town in Mumias West.  According to Mumias West OCPD Steven Muoni the matter was being investigated to establish the motive behind it and the culprits.  “He (Barasa) filed a complaint and said that the billboard is worth Sh200,000 and we recorded the matter as malicious damage of the property," said Mr Muoni.  But the police commander dismissed speculations linking senator Malala to the incident.  “We have officially begun our investigation and this is the official position of police that no suspect has been arrested in relation to vandalism, people should ignore rumors being peddled around."  He urged residents with any useful information in regard to the incident to record a statement that will assist the police in investigating the matter.
