Nakuru County Police Commander Beatrice Kiraguri. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Nakuru County Commander Beatrice Kiraguri has admitted that the rising cases of depression among police officers is worrying and that the National Police Service (NPS) is working to reduce cases through various means like counselling and sports.  Ms Kiraguri noted that police officers are human beings who are also affected by family issues, working conditions and harsh economic times, adding that Nakuru has a ‘healing boot football tournament’ where officers take time to unwind and engage the public.  “The harsh working environment and operating in hardship areas takes a toll on some officers who get affected by depression just like other human beings,” she said.  Kiraguri also observed that crime levels in the county had fallen due to the good working relations between police officers and the public. Kiraguri was addressing the press after visiting Gilgil Special School where police officers donated foodstuffs and non-food items to the institution which has 125 students.      By Antony Gitonga | 41 minutes ago By Michael Saitoti | 12 hours ago By Kennedy K Gachuhi | 22 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 22 hours ago
