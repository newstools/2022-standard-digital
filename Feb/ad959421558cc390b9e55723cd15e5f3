The battle for the crown as top East African Safari Classic Rally speedster today shook Nakuru County’s undulating landscape as drivers revved off to 451km of competitive racing.    In a battle royale, 45 drivers are currently testing their endurance in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua, passing through the Rhino Gate, onwards to the heat-strokes of Laikipia to Moguni and are expected to tunnel from the scenic Il Polei to the high folding hills of Loldaiga late Friday.
