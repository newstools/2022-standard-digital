President Uhuru Kenyatta's Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita [Jenipher Wachie, Standard]  President Uhuru Kenyatta's Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita on Sunday began warming up to campaigns for Machakos governor's seat.  Speaking to journalists after attending a church service at Kyaani ABC in Machakos constituency, Mr Waita announced that he would retire from civil service today (February 8) to join the race for the seat now occupied by Dr Alfred Mutua.  Mr Waita, however, disclosed some high ranking politicians were harassing him. He said they urged him not to vie due to his age.   "They are telling me to wait for another time as am still young which l have dismissed," said Waita.    Mr Waita added he had already been persuaded by the people of Machakos to vie for the seat so that he can transform the rich experience he has acquired while serving in the national Government.  "According to the research that l have done in the county, most resources that are supposed to benefit the locals have not been properly utilised," he said.  The President's Chief of Staff said his vehicle of choice is the Azimio la Umoja formation. However, he did not disclose the specific party he will align with.  Mr Waita later had a good time with students who attended the church service and later met several church women and other groups.  He urged the Kamba community to rally behind Azimio la Umoja.
