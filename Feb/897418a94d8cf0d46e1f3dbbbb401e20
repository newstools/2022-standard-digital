Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru at a past event [David Njaaga, Standard]  At least 106,990 people have received their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Kirinyaga County.  This translates to 24 per cent of the adult population, while about 150,781 people have received their first dose. About 1,770 people have already received booster shots.  The Kirinyaga County government has launched a 10-day accelerated vaccination drive targeting 50,000 adults. Director of Medical Services George Karoki says 49 medics will run vaccination campaigns in the five sub-counties.  "All 29 centres will offer the doses, and each sub-county is targeting to vaccinate 10,000 residents," Karoki said.   He spoke at the launch of the initiative on Wednesday at the Kerugoya County Referral Hospital. Karoki said there were seven confirmed positive cases at the hospital, with five of the patients on oxygen while two others are in isolation wards.  Governor Anne Waiguru has asked residents to get vaccinated. “Covid-19 is still with us, let’s all get vaccinated. The fears about the vaccine we had at the beginning have all been settled."
