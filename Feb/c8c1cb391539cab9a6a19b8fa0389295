A vandalised transformer in Ongoro village, Rachuonyo East, Homa Bay. August 2021. [James Omoro, Standard]  The Kenya Power company is losing five transformers every month to vandals, Nyamira County Commissioner Michael Lesimam has said.  Mr Lesimam said yesterday that increased vandalism is making Kenya Power unable to maintain electricity supply to clients.  The crimes, the county commissioner said, were being perpetrated even after President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a moratorium against trade in scrap metal across the country.  He said security agents in the region were investigating the crime. “Already, we have profiled about 15 culprits whom we are following up,” Lesimam said.  He said security officials are monitoring scrap metal dealers to establish those who did not heed the president’s decree.  “The presidential order was very clear and if we find anyone engaging in the trade, we shall deal with them according to the law,” he warned.  Kenya Power’s Business Manager in charge of Nyamira Daniel Ariri said the company was working to restore supply in the affected areas.  “Let us all participate in taking care of our power supply lines and equipment in order to guard our economy,” Ariri said.
