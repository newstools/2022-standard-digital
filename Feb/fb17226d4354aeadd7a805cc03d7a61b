[Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has thrown his hat in the ring for the Kiambu governorship contest.  Kuria will now battle it out against ex-Governor William Kabogo and incumbent James Nyoro in the August 9 polls.  The Gatundu MP took to social media today to declare his bid. He is now set to vie for Governor under his Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) party.   “Vox Populi, Vox Dei (the voice of the people is the voice of God') So help me God. Under your wings, I feel safe. Mungu mbele,” Kuria said.  The announcement came a day after the legislator, on Friday sent, out a non-scientific poll asking Kenyans which seat he should vie for.  In the poll, he asked Kenyans whether he should seek re-election as Gatundu South MP or vie for Kiambu Governor, the Deputy President of Kenya or just remain as CCK Party Leader.  The results of the polls were evenly split across nearly 14,000 of his followers who took part in the poll.  Kuria returned to the country this month after spending three months at the American Hospital in Dubai where he had surgery after sustaining third-degree burns from a malfunctioning heating mat.  On arrival, the MP held a thanksgiving service rally at Thika Stadium which was attended by party bosses Martha Karua (Narc Kenya), Mwangi Kiunjuri (TSP) as well as Kiambu Governor James Nyoro, MP Patrick Wainaina and a host of other leaders.  In Thika, Kuria said he has been asked to take a stand - to choose between Azimio la Umoja or Ruto's UDA. However, he said, he was in neither of the two. He was on God's side.  Kuria made a clarion call to Kenyans urging them to vote for leaders based on merit in the next General Elections.     By Jacob Ng'etich | 2 hours ago By Josphat Thiong'o | 2 hours ago By Oscar Obonyo | 2 hours ago By Biketi Kikechi | 2 hours ago
