Kangema constituency is mourning the demise of former MP Tiras Ngahu.   Ngahu succumbed to throat cancer at a Nairobi hospital.  He joined politics from the private sector and with the support of late Cabinet minister John Michuki's family, he clinched the Kangema seat in 2013.   In Parliament, Ngahu was branded TNA 1, and in the 2013 election, he was elected and continued with legacy projects that were left behind by Michuki.  Last year, the deceased was a promoter of BBI and later appointed in the Azimio la Umoja initiative in charge of Murang’a County. Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria eulogized Ngahu as a leader who he consulted on various issues owing to his expertise in developmental matters.  “It is with deep sorrow that I have received news of the demise of my great friend, a former Kangema MP. He was a visionary leader who shared ideas with others for the interest of Murang’a county,” said Iria.  Julius Mwangi, a resident of Muguru, remembered Ngahu as a leader who unified the constituency as he mobilized them to buy land in Laikipia County for commercial maize farming.  “We had high hopes in his leadership. He was supportive and was working towards establishing a dairy plant in Muguru ward,” said Mwangi.
