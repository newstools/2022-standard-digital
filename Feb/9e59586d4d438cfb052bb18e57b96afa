Father Francis Opondo died last Friday at an Eldoret hospital. [File]  Leaders and residents of Trans Nzoia are mourning the death of Catholic priest Father Francis Opondo who died at a hospital in Eldoret.  Many described Father Opondo as an icon of the peace who played a reconciliatory role during tribal clashes along Trans Nzoia and West Pokot counties in 1992.  Since his death last Friday, Opondo's body has been taken to Kiminini, Mitume, Cathedral, and Kapkoi parish churches for public viewing.  At Immaculate Church, where Opondo served as assistant bishop to Bishop Maurice Crowley, hundreds of faithful trooped to the church to view his body. Vicar General Micah Kibet led the faithful in mourning the departed priest and described him as the pillar in the church.  "Opondo is an icon of peace. He dialogued for peace at Trans Nzoia and West Pokot border, where many lives were lost to tribal clashes," said Kibet.  After the restoration of peace along the border of the two counties, he mobilised resources to reconstruct destroyed homes.  "The peace being enjoyed at Kwanza constituency at Trans Nzoia and West Pokot border is as a result of sacrifices that father Opondo made when he served as the priest in charge of Kolongolo parish," said Kibet.  Opondo will be buried today at St John Sirende parish.     By Kennedy Gachuhi and Daniel Chege | 1 hour ago By Gardy Chacha | 3 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 3 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 3 hours ago
