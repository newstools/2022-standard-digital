Nyandarua County Assembly, 2014. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Members of the Nyandarua County Assembly have urged the County Executive to consider allocating money in the budget for the construction of more public abattoirs.  The Assembly Committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries observed that the county has a total of 71 slaughterhouses with only three public slaughterhouses; Mirangine, Olkalou and Miharati owned and managed by the County Government of Nyandarua.   Nominated ward representative Salome Gathoni in a statement sought to know the status of the abattoir at Ol Kalou Municipality and all other county abattoirs in terms of operation, sanitation and revenue raised.  The statement response was issued by nominated MCA Esther Mwangi on behalf of the committee chairperson, Andrew Kamau. While giving the response, Ms Mwangi noted that with an increasing population, there is a need to have proper plans put in place for the upgrade of existing abattoirs that are in degradable conditions.  “Olkalou abattoir sits on a small area of less than a quarter acre and is within the riparian reserve. The Olkalou Municipality had promised to relocate the abattoir but it is taking too long,” she noted.  She said they will follow up the matter with the Olkalou municipality on its promise to relocate the abattoir.  Assembly Speaker, Ndegwa Wahome acknowledged the great role private abattoirs play but insisted on the need for the County to have well-structured public abattoirs.    Njabini Kiburu Ward MCA, Kiiru Gachomba noted that upgrading public abattoirs to modern facilities will increase revenue generation.  “Most of our abattoirs in their current state are not attractive in terms of revenue generation. This shows that there is more work that still needs to be done,” Gachomba said.
