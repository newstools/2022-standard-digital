Laikipia Woman Rep Cate Waruguru addresses a past United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party rally. [Courtesy]  Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru says she has no apologies to make over a viral video, in which she was captured hurling unkind words at former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri.  A section of Kenyans on social media said her remarks were reckless, demeaning and inappropriate.  Waruguru now claims that the online users don’t understand the context of her acrimony against Kiunjuri.  She alleges that their hostile relationship stems from personal issues between the two. The Standard won’t publish the claims made by Waruguru against Kiunjuri due to legal implications.  Waruguru said she took her personal fight to the public “to teach Kiunjuri a lesson”.  “He can sue me, I won’t withdraw the statements,” she said.  It has been reported that Kiunjuri introduced Waruguru to politics in 2013, but the lawmaker denies the claims.  “How could he front my name for nomination as Member of County Assembly, yet his attempt to win the 2013 Laikipia gubernatorial seat failed?” posed Waruguru.  The two will compete against each other in the Laikipia East parliamentary election on August 9, 2022.  The Standard recently reached Kiunjuri for comment, but he didn’t pick calls or respond to texts.
