The man's body was taken to Kakamega County Referral Mortuary. [Courtesy]  A mob lynched a 40-year-old man for allegedly defiling his three-year-old niece and burning her body.  Mwanje Shiundu is said to have been intoxicated when he committed the act at Soko Mjinga village in Malava.  "Shiundu smokes bhang and is an alcoholic. That might have driven him to commit the heinous act," said a neighbour.  According to Joel Mapele, a relative, the mother of the child alerted him that her daughter was missing and they immediately launched a search and found the child lying naked and dead. The suspect was lynched. [Courtesy]  Kakamega North police boss Paul Mwenda urged local residents to remain calm as the matter was being investigated.  "Cases of defilement need to be reported for action and prosecution in court. Lynching the suspect does not help since it hinders the family from getting justice," he said.  The bodies were taken to Kakamega County Referral Mortuary.  The family, led by the child's father Munandi Shiundu, has condemned the incident and called on authorities to investigate defilement cases in the area.  "I was shocked to receive news that my brother had defiled my daughter and burnt the body. It's hurting. I don't know what got into him to commit such an incidence," he said.
