Nairobi Gubernatorial aspirant Richard Ngatia on campaigns in Nairobi on February 06, 2022. [Courtesy, Standard]  With the General Election six months away, aspirants are pulling all the stops to woo the youth.  In Nairobi, like other regions, candidates are scrambling to win over the bloc with the majority of aspirants promising to create jobs and business opportunities.  Among those in the race to be governor is the president of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Richard Ngatia.  Others are Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi, Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu, businesswoman Ann Kagure, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and Senator Johnson Sakaja. Speaking when he met youth groups and students in Nairobi on Wednesday, Ngatia pledged to fix unemployment if he is elected city boss.  ''First, I will have a round table with leaders of major industries in Nairobi to find a way of accomodating the youth. I will bring investors using my networks as President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry so that we can persuade them to come to Kenya and start industries and factories that can help employ our young men and women from colleges and universities,'' he said.  Ngatia said he will improve the city's infrastructure to ease the way of doing business.  ''I want this city to get good roads and increase markets so that it can net more revenue for the county. I will also ensure as a county we don't lose revenue,'' added Ngatia.  He noted that pending land cases should be settled and such parcels put to good use for public use.
