Wines and spirits owners within Nairobi will now pay Sh12,000 for a 12-month license after the charges were slashed from Sh24,000. [Willis Awandu, Standard]  Bar and liquor store owners in Nairobi now have a reason to smile after the Nairobi county government slashed the license fees by 50 per cent.  This is after the Nairobi county assembly on Tuesday adopted the Finance Bill 2021 which slashed operation fees of bars from Sh50,000 to Sh25,000 for a 12-month license. Charges for a 6-months or less license were also revised from Sh30,000 to Sh15,000.  However, online hailing taxis have been slapped with a new Sh1,000 monthly parking charge. Private vehicles will also be charged Sh35,000 for a yearly license, Sh20,000 for a 6-month license, Sh10,000 for a 3-month license and Sh4,000 for a one-month operational license.  City Hall retained parking fees for salon cars at Sh200 against an earlier proposal to hike the same to Sh400 in the Central Business District, (CBD) classified under Zone I. Wines and spirits owners within Nairobi will now pay Sh12,000 for a 12-month license after the charges were slashed from Sh24,000. Those seeking a six-month or less license will only pay Sh7,000 as opposed to the current charge of Sh14,000.  Budget and Appropriations committee chairperson Robert Mbatia explained that the move to review the charges downwards was informed by the current ‘painful’ business environment due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “The bar and liquor store owners submitted that the costs required review to reduce multiplicity and help them compensate for the long closure period caused by Covid- 19. In this regard, the committee has proposed that the relevant charges be reduced by 50 per cent,” stated Mbatia.  According to the last census report on the number of bars in Nairobi in 2016 by the County Liquor and Licensing Board, there were more than 12,500 licensed bars and liquor outlets. The number has since increased.  Nairobi County Assembly Budget and Appropriations committee chairperson Robert Mbatia, 2020.
