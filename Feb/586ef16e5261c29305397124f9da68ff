Residents of Kawa Junction in Suna East, Migori County were left in awe after a police officer sprayed his wife with 16 bullets before turning the gun on himself.  Some residents speculated she was expectant.  The officer who was stationed at Migori Police Station is said to have left work at 11 pm for his house.  Migori County Commander Mark Wanjala said the officer left his workstation without returning his firearm, an AK47. Neighbours told police they heard the policeman and his wife arguing before gunshots rent the air at around 1.40 am.  Wanjala noted the police officer sprayed 16 bullets on his wife before shooting himself.  "The firearm had 13 bullets remaining after the officer spent 17 cartridges," Wanjala said.  When police arrived at the scene, they found the lifeless body of the policeman and his wife in the living room as their two-year-old daughter, who was unhurt watched helplessly.  Residents speculated the slain woman was expectant. However, Wanjala noted that he could not ascertain if she was expectant.   "I don't know about the pregnancy," Wanjala said.  The bodies of the two were taken to Migori County Referral Hospital's morgue.  By Edwin Nyarangi | 8 hours ago By James Omoro | 2 days ago By James Munyeki | 2 days ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 2 days ago
