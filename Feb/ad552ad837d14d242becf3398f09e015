Embattled Nyandarua County Assembly speaker Ndegwa Wahome after being denied access to the county assembly on May 25, 2021. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Members of the County Assembly yesterday resumed business for the sixth session of the second Assembly after a long recess following the impeachment of Speaker Ndegwa Wahome which the courts overturned.  The session was marked by prayers by religious and cultural leaders in the county.  Karau Ward MCA Ken Mukirah who was sitting as the Speaker called for diligence in the implementation of the remaining projects as their term comes to an end.   He also noted that the Office of the Speaker would enquire whether the County Governor intends to give a state of the county address.    "Last year we did not have a State of the County address; my office will make inquiries on whether the Governor intends to give one," said Mukirah.   Njabini-Kiburu MCA, Kiiru Gachomba urged the County Executive to provide the house with the Annual Budget Estimates for FY 2022/2023 for approval.   "The budget estimates will influence what is to be implemented by the next government. We, therefore, need to look into those estimates as soon as possible and pass the budget before time lapses,” Kiiru said.   Githioro Ward MCA, Sambigi Mukuria called on the County Executive to introduce the supplementary budget to enable pay contractors.   "There is limited time to implement pending projects and some of our contractors still have not been paid. We need to have the supplementary budget as soon as possible,” Sambigi noted.   Gatimu Ward MCA, Kieru Wambui urged members to use the remaining time to implement pending projects in their wards. He also requested the Speaker that the House retains its previous calendar.   By James Munyeki | 5 hours ago By Boniface Gikandi | 1 day ago By Boniface Gikandi | 2 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 2 days ago
