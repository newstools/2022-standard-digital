Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei [David Njaaga, Standard]  Two senators allied to Deputy President William Ruto have alleged a scheme by the government to delay issuing of IDs to residents in perceived UDA strongholds thereby denying them an opportunity to register as voters.  Nandi’s Samson Cherargei and his Murang’a counterpart Irungu Kanga’ata claimed the delay was part of an alleged attempt by the Ministry of Interior to scuttle Dr Ruto’s presidential aspirations.  Speaking in Kapsabet on Sunday, the two urged Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Mating’i and his PS Karanja Kibicho to speed up the process and allow residents can register as voters.  “There is a plot to deny residents of some parts of the country the right to vote by withholding IDs or delaying their issuance. Even delivering IDs at the offices of the chiefs for applicants to collect them has been a problem,” Cherargei said.   Irungu said Mt Kenya region is solidly behind the DP in his bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.  “They are frustrating us because we are campaigning for Ruto. We have resolved to soldier on despite threats,” said Irungu.         By Kennedy Gachuhi and James Munyeki | 4 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 4 hours ago By Nathan Ochunge | 4 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 11 hours ago
