Ann Ngirita wants to vie for Nakuru Woman Representative on a Jubilee ticket. [Courtesy]  Ann Ngirita, has disclosed her reason for dumping the United Democratic Alliance (UDA), minutes after she was officially welcomed to the Jubilee party at their Nakuru branch office.  Ngirita became a popular name in Kenyan households after she was named as a suspect linked to the Sh9 billion National Youth Service (NYS) scandal.  While addressing journalists outside the ruling party’s offices in a viral video, Ngirita said she made a wrong decision to join the UDA party out of ‘peer pressure'.  “I heard Baba (ODM leader Raila Odinga) on TV asking us to go home and that is when I realised that I was lost,” she told the journalists in Swahili. She added, “I joined UDA for peer pressure, it was not the party I wanted. Baba is Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta,”.    Initially, the party had dismissed her request to join but made a U-turn later on.  Ngirita is eyeing a political seat (Woman Representative) in Nakuru County where she pledges to help women and children.  Together with her three relatives, Ngirita was arrested and charged in 2018 after they were linked to the NYS scandal.  During the investigation, it was established that Ngirita, received a tender to supply food, stationery, firewood among other items.  Together with others, she was charged for allegedly receiving Sh59 million from NYS and supplying nothing. The case is pending in court.
