[File]  The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) is targeting 90 schools in Makueni County with a new campaign to enhance safety for road users, especially learners.  The Usalama Barabarani campaign will also cover Nairobi, Kisumu, Nakuru, and Kericho counties.  Most of the schools targeted in Makueni are located along major roads and highways, according to NTSA Lower Eastern regional director Rosyln Oloo.  Ms Oloo said the five had reported the most road accidents annually. At least 200km of Mombasa-Nairobi highway are in Makueni, which puts many, including learners, at risk when crossing the road.    Most accidents have been attributed to human error, majorly carelessness by drivers.  NTSA has also listed Kibwezi-Kitui, Wote-Makindu and Wote-Machakos roads as dangerous to students. “We want to increase awareness through sensitising school-going children, who we will give lollipop signs and bag covers,” said Oloo  Lollipop signs will be assigned to school captains to assist other learners to cross roads.    By Erastus Mulwa | 1 day ago By Hudson Gumbihi | 4 days ago By Muriithi Mugo | 8 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 8 days ago
