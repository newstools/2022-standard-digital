Murang'a Women Rep Sabina Chege, when she appeared before the IEBC's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee on February 15, 2022, at IEBC headquarters at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi. [Edward Kiplimo, Standard]  Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege failed to appear before the IEBC Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee yesterday for a hearing on her election rigging remarks.  Her lawyers Otiende Amollo, James Orengo and Martin Aloo told IEBC she had been hospitalised since February 16, a day after she first appeared before the commission. Mr Amollo presented a letter by Dr Eric Munene. “  The respondent is indisposed... undergoing treatment and with those circumstances, she is not ready to be with us. We request that we reschedule the hearing to when she will be available,” said Amollo before IEBC Chair Wafula Chebukati.
