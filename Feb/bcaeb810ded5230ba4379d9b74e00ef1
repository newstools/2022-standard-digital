Some morans have vowed to stop harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriages.  This is after they were sensitised on the effects of harmful cultural practices on the lives of girls.  The Pastoral Child Foundation county director Simon Leadismo said the morans have been empowered on the importance of education, stopping female genital mutilation in their communities, and child marriage.  “We have selected them from different villages that we work in. We chose three warriors from Lorubae, Lerata, Kirtaman to empower their community members to know the importance of education and effects of FGM,” he said.   Mr Leadismo said the war against FGM will succeed if the new generation of warriors has a role to play in it.  Christopher Mark Lekaram from Lorubae village in Samburu East said they will work with youth from their respective communities in protecting girls against harmful practices.  “We have said no to FGM, we will marry girls who are not circumcised. We have agreed to end all these harmful practices,’ said Samwel Kampala, a resident.      By Antony Gitonga | 41 minutes ago By Antony Gitonga | 11 hours ago By Kennedy K Gachuhi | 22 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 22 hours ago
