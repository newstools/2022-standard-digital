Jematia was arrested today morning within Nairobi’s Westpark Estate and driven to Nairobi Area DCI offices for questioning.  Standard Digital has since learnt she was driven to Eldoret for further questioning by the local DCI office. The EALA legislator had been on the run after she was summoned to record a statement over remarks she made during a meeting over the weekend.  On Tuesday, police said they had launched a manhunt for the MP to give details of her remarks during the Mochongoi ward meeting.  Baringo County Commissioner Abdirizak Jaldesa said two other local politicians who were also present in the said meeting had recorded statements.   “The MP has gone underground after we summoned her to appear before the committee. We have sufficient evidence to charge her with incitement to violence,” Jeldesa said.  According to authorities, Jematia allegedly told residents of Mochongoi in Baringo South Constituency to raise funds to purchase firearms.  She is alleged to have said that the government funds said are not helping anyone as a result of insecurity.  On January 4, bandits attacked Yatia in the same sub-county, killing herder Vincent Tuwit, 24.  On December 11 last year, AP officer David Omondi was shot dead in Chepkesin, Baringo North. He was with his colleagues on a routine security patrol.  By Collins Kweyu | 1 hour ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 17 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 1 day ago By Stephanie Wangari | 1 day ago
