Vihiga County Governor Wilber Ottichilo [Abigael Chepkemoi, Standard]  The County Government of Vihiga has defended itself after posts on social media platforms claimed it had been listed as the worst county when it comes utilisation of World Bank grants.  In a statement, Governor Wilber Ottichilo said the report was a highlight of his predecessor Moses Akaranga.  "It has come to our attention that a newspaper publication on the World Bank report on counties' ranking in terms of use of Kenya Devolution Support Programme (KDSP) finances is going round and eliciting false interpretation of the report," read the part of the press release issued by Victor Wetende, the county's communications officer.  "The World Bank did a report in the 2017/2018 financial year on the use of previous financial allocation. Unfortunately, Vihiga's performance was dismal but this is the year that the current regime was just settling in office after the Akaranga reign," reads the statement.  KDSP team conducted the assessment based on key areas such as public finance management, planning and monitoring.     By Robert Amalemba | 12 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 1 day ago By Omelo Juliet | 4 days ago By Brian Kisanji | 4 days ago
