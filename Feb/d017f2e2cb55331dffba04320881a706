The Kiambere-Embakasi Highway voltage transmission power line that fell with three others causing a power outage on January 11, 2021. [David Gichuru, Standard]  The Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) is on the spot for failing to compensate tens of families displaced from its wayleave in Naivasha.  The company has since been blamed for the impasse that had led to cases of vandalism along major power lines in the country.  Last month, the Olkaria-Lessos-Kisumu, Kiambere-Embakasi and Loiyangalani-Suswa high voltage power lines were vandalised, plunging parts of the country into darkness.   Naivasha Sub-county security committee yesterday met various government agencies to deliberate on the recent cases of vandalism that had targeted various infrastructures.  During the meeting, it emerged that the vandalism cases had ended since President Uhuru Kenyatta banned the scrap metal trade although there was bitterness among uncompensated families.  According to Naivasha Sub-County Deputy Commissioner Mutua Kisilu, a multi-agency team had been formed to inspect the electricity towers in the town.  He noted that all the towers that had been vandalised had been repaired while a contractor was on site to fill gullies left open by sand harvesters.  “As we address the challenges facing the towers, Ketraco should also make sure that all families affected by the power lines are compensated so as to heal the current enmity,” he said.  Mutua added that in the last couple of months, 32 transformers had been vandalised in Naivasha.  Addressing the press after the meeting, the deputy commissioner said that they would be engaging the public in protecting the critical power towers and lines.  Meanwhile, over 150 families living along the Olkaria-Lessos-Kisumu power line have been served with eviction notices.
