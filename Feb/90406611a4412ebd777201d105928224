Nakuru Deputy County Commissioner (DCC) has resigned to join politics ahead of the coming general elections. Nakuru East DCC Eric Wanyonyi yesterday announced his resignation from the civil service, bringing to an end his 25 years career in public service.  “Effective today, I have tendered my resignation from the civil service after serving the country for slightly over 25 years. I thank the President for according me the opportunity to serve,” said Wanyonyi.  He explained that serving in the various capacities in civil service had given him the necessary exposure to now seek leadership from a political perspective.  “I will be vying for Kabuchai Parliamentary seat in the elections. I have worked in various counties in Rift Valley and Nyanza regions from where I have acquired the necessary skills,” said Wanyonyi.   The Kabuchai Parliamentary seat is currently held by Majimbo Kalasinga who is also set to defend it even as Wanyonyi maintains that he is best fit to run the affairs of the constituency.
