Wiper leader Kalonzo Mosyoka during the second memorial service of former President Daniel arap Moi in Kabarak, Nakuru. [Harun Wathari, Standard]  Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has refuted claims that they have placed conditions and irreducible minimums for the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) to join the ODM leader Raila Odinga led with Azimio la Umoja movement.  Speaking after attending service at Redeemed Gospel Church in Huruma, Nairobi, Kalonzo said OKA principals are leaders of integrity and cannot put conditions on other people in order to work with them.    Further, the Wiper leader said OKA is growing strong and that it will be the one welcoming the other formations into their alliance and not the other way round.  There has been pressure from all quotas for the OKA team to team up with Azimio to guarantee a round one win against Kenya Kwanza Alliance formation but principals Kalonzo, Kanu chairman Gideon Moi, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua and Cyrus Jirongo have been adamant that other formations should join them.  At the same time, the Wiper leader challenged the office of the Attorney-General to look into the law that regulates the registration of churches saying their right of worship as enshrined in the Constitution has been infringed.  He noted that the regulations on registration of churches negate the right to worship and the AG should move with speed and recommend for the review of the same through Parliament.  Kalonzo said those accusing the church of engaging in business got it all wrong because there is no wrong in engaging in other ventures as long as it creates employment and empowers the less fortunate in society.  He urged Kenyans to elect leaders of integrity who will protect their wealth but not steal it to the decrement of the masses.
