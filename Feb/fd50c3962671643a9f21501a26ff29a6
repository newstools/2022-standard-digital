Eight people have been shot dead in another weekend of fighting in Kerio Valley.  The eight, among them two minors were killed in a fierce gun battle between herders from two warring communities in a grazing field in Chesetan near the border of Marakwet East and Tiaty sub-counties of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties respectively.  Livestock was reportedly stolen in the Saturday evening attacks.  Authorities said attackers, suspected to be from one community staged a raid at around 5pm and stole some cattle, sparking a deadly shootout in retaliation. Rift Valley Regional Commissioner Mohamed Maalim said four armed herders from Tiaty and four others from Marakwet East were shot dead in the evening attack.    Maalim said the two minors killed in the attack are aged 15 and 12.   "The minors were not attacked in schools - they were caught up herding livestock in the grazing fields."  He said a number of attackers who were injured in the evening fights will be interrogated soon after treatment.  Hours later, this Sunday morning, locals reported several gunshots in Sokobora in Marakwet East. It was not clear whether the morning gunshots are as a result of another attack.
