The woman allegedly hanged herself while the minors were killed through poisoning. [Courtesy]  Detectives are suspecting foul play in the death of a woman and her three children in Gilgil, Nakuru a week ago.  The woman’s body was found with a gunny bag on her head inside a room where her children’s decomposing bodies were lying.  Gilgil OCPD John Onditi said sleuths were following several leads.  He confirmed that the state of the minors’ bodies and that of the mother was different, adding that they were waiting for post-mortem examination report. “We are looking at various angles in these deaths and we have involved scene-of-crime officers to help us get to the bottom of this incident,” he said.  The minors are suspected to have been killed five days before their mother met her death in what was initially suspected to be suicide.  Officers attached to the DCI office are now investigating where the 32-year-old woman identified as Maureen Akinyi was all that time.  The woman allegedly hanged herself while the minors were killed through poisoning in their Teachers-B estate house. The woman’s husband, who is a Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) officer, was in Somalia.  A source involved in the investigations said that they were not ruling out foul play in the murder after several questions emerged.  Gilgil MP Martha Wangari termed the incident as scary and worrying and called on parents to speak up about their challenges.  She noted that the woman had in a four-page document allegedly detailed her tribulations in the marriage before deciding to take her life and that of her three minors.  “There are many stories and theories in this incident and we hope that the police will get to the bottom of this painful murder of innocent children,” she said.   By Antony Gitonga | 11 hours ago By Michael Saitoti | 12 hours ago By Kennedy K Gachuhi | 22 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 22 hours ago
