Former State House Chief of staff Nzioka Waita. [File, Standard]  Nzioka Waita, the State House Chief of Staff, has officially resigned from his post, to focus on his Machakos Governor quest.  In a statement dated February 9, the statehouse aide thanked the Head of State for giving him the opportunity to serve the country in the last seven years.  “As I bid farewell to the house on the hill, I wish to thank the president for the honour of appointing me as a member of his administration and for allowing me to serve over the past seven years,” his statement read in part.  A week ago, Waita talked about his entry into the murky waters of politics and his plans for Machakos county for the first time. Speaking on Citizen TV on Tuesday last week, Waita stated that his plan is to serve the people of Machakos, as he outlined his larger dream of making the county a metropolis for Nairobi.    "Machakos, Kiambu, Murang’a and Kajiado counties are within the Nairobi ecosystem. I want to make sure the county of Machakos benefits from the growth of the Nairobi metropolitan and the metropolitan infrastructure," he said on Citizen TV.  Waita noted that Governor Alfred Mutua had his agenda for the county and as he pushed for it in his capacity as governor, he was also pushing for the same from the State House.  "I have maintained my role as an honest broker for all the leaders in the region to ensure if they had development agendas that needed airtime I would raise my hand."
