Omingo Magara shifts allegiance from the UDA party. [Courtesy]  UDA National Treasurer Omingo Magara has announced his exit from the United Democratic Alliance (UDA).  While addressing the media, Magara attributed his move to a lack of transparency and democracy in the party.  “There are new developments that render my candidature on the party ticket impossible. I am going to talk and find new political suitors with who we share interests,” he said.  Magara had shown interest in the Kisii Governor seat on a UDA ticket. Less than a day ago, Magara was trending on Social media with claims of resignation from the party.  Information dominating social media indicated that Magara, a close ally to the Deputy President William Ruto had resigned and was to join the Azimio la Umoja Movement.  Through his official Twitter account, Magara dismissed the allegations as rumours and asked Kenyans to ignore them.     By Moses Nyamori and Jacob Ng’etich | 3 hours ago By Jacob Ng'etich | 5 hours ago By Stephanie Wangari and Winfrey Owino | 5 hours ago By Denis Kabaara | 6 hours ago
