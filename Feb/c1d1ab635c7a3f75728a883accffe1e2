Missing blogger Bogonko Bosire’s father has died at his Kamuri village home in Kuresoi North, Nakuru County.   David Bosire died on Monday, hardly a month after his son Joshua Mangwari committed suicide on January 16.  “Our father died peacefully at home on Monday. It is so painful bearing in mind that we were still coming to terms with the death of my elder brother Mangwari,” said Shem Onuong’a, the family’s lastborn.  Onuong’a said it came as a shock as his father had started showing signs of recovery. “He had also started recovering his memory,” he said.  “Our father has, in the last few days, been recovering. On Sunday, around 3pm, he had guests who had come to check on him and we were when he started questioning why Mangwari committed suicide,” said Onuong’a. The family feels Bosire’s condition was among the factors that pushed Mangwari to commit suicide. He ingested poison.   Family sources said he may have been depressed. They said Mangwari faced many challenges taking care of his 72-year-old father.  First time  “It was troubling for us and for him. How do you start explaining to him the circumstances under which his son committed suicide? It was the first time he asked about him,” said Onuong’a.  “Mzee has been suffering since my brother Bogonko went missing in 2013. We have tried our best to ensure he gets his medication on time but it is unfortunate that he has died before our missing brother is found,” he said.  Bogonko’s disappearance was linked to his job as a blogger who fearlessly exposed ills in the country.  Onuong’a said Bogonko was the family’s main breadwinner and his disappearance plunged them into financial struggles.  “He was very supportive to the family. He gave our parents the land on which their current home is. We are still hopeful he will one day show up alive and well,” he said.     By Renee Were | 3 hours ago By Obare Osinde | 3 hours ago By James Wanzala | 3 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 3 hours ago
