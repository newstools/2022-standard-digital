Cabinet Secretary for Water, Sanitation and Irrigation Sicily Kariuki. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  Over 70,000 households in parts of Ndaragwa Constituency are set to benefit from a multi-million water project courtesy of the national government through the National Irrigation Authority.   The Sh200 million Karagoini water project will serve Leshau Pondo, Kiriita, Ndaragwa central and Mbuyu areas upon completion in two months.  While inspecting the project this week, Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said the project was about 90 per cent complete.  The project had earlier stalled after differences between Karagoini water project members and the management.   “I want to assure residents that they will have access to the water in two months,” she said.  Already, she said that some 15,000 families had access to the water.  “We have pumped an additional Sh11 million for water connectivity,” she added.   By James Munyeki | 5 hours ago By Boniface Gikandi | 1 day ago By Boniface Gikandi | 2 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 2 days ago
