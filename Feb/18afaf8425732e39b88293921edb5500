[Courtesy]  A police officer has been arrested after being linked to a robbery with violence incident at a mall in Kasarani, Nairobi County, where Sh2.2 million was reportedly stolen.  Police Corporal Geoffrey Korir Kiplangat was arrested by officers from Special Crimes at Allsops after being positively identified by the victim, Daniel Owiri Nyagaka.  In a report filed at Kasarani Police Station, Nyagaka said he was confronted by Kiplangat and three other men at Thika Road Mall, Gate H, where he was to purchase a power saw from his friend, Dilip Otieno Hongo.  According to Nyagaka, the four were posing as police officers and armed with a pistol. They handcuffed him alongside Otieno, ransacked his vehicle, a Toyota Mark X, and made away with Sh2.2 million in cash and two HP laptops, all valued at Sh134,000.  The suspects also forcefully sent Sh2,500 from their M-Pesa accounts to a different recipient’s number – a Korir Geoffrey, and hurriedly left the scene.  Upon investigation, Kiplangat was arrested at his Allsops home in Kasarani where police recovered a Ceska pistol, 15 rounds of ammunition, a jungle trouser, a red beret and a badge.
