UDA chairman Johnstone Muthama. [Courtesy]  The chairperson of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party Johnson Muthama has told Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka that he (Musyoka) is not needed in UDA.  Speaking at his office in Tala, Machakos County on Wednesday, January 9, Muthama said Musyoka has been “pretending” that UDA is interested in him, yet “that is not the case”.  “I want to ask Kalonzo to stop pretending that UDA is looking for him for talks. At the Kenya Kwanza [alliance] and UDA, we are contented working with [Musalia] Mudavadi and [Moses] Wetang’ula,” said Muthama.  The former Machakos Senator’s remarks come a few weeks after Deputy President William Ruto asked Musyoka to join forces with him as he (Ruto) seeks to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 9 General Election. On January 29, while speaking at Unoa Grounds in Wote, Makueni County, Kalonzo said working with UDA was not one of the options for him.  "Our resolution is that we are going forward. This journey I will not go alone, I will negotiate on behalf of the community but for those who have shown us arrogance, like UDA, we are sorry, we will not work with you. I can’t team up with Ruto and that’s me,” he said.  Muthama now says UDA stands a good chance of victory in the August 9 presidential election, even without Musyoka’s support.  “We are confident we will win the upcoming election,” he said.  It is reported that the Azimio la Umoja Movement and the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) are considering a pact that would see the two outfits work together before and after the August 9 elections.
