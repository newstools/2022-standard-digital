Dennis Magu Njeru, the Chief of Kiamugumo Sub-location in Kirinyaga County with his wife Jedidah Wanja who allegedly stabbed him to death on Wednesday night in an undated photo. [Timothy Kariuki, Standard]  A judge has declined to release on bond the wife of a chief who was murdered last December.  High Court Judge Richard Mwango ruled that Jedidah Wanja, 35, be held at the Embu Majimbo Women Prison for her own safety.  Dennis Magu Njeru, 37, was stabbed on December 15, 2021, at Githure village in Gichugu sub-county.    He was the assistant chief for Kiamugumo sub-location.  In his ruling on an application for a bond, Mwongo expressed concerns over Wanja's safety although she had indicated in her bond submission that she would move to Nairobi from Kirinyaga to avoid interfering with witnesses and for her own safety.  However, the court noted that regardless of her willingness to relocate, there were no court records or supportive affidavits assuring her security from those willing to accommodate her.  The probation officer's report stated that Wanja's security would be compromised if she were to return to her home because neighbours were still bitter about Njeru's death.  According to the report, on the day Njeru was killed, Wanja was allegedly rescued by the area chief from irate locals who wanted to lynch her.   By Jane Mugambi | 10 hours ago By James Munyeki | 19 hours ago By James Munyeki | 19 hours ago By Boniface Gikandi | 2 days ago
