Trans Nzoia Woman Rep Hon Janet Nangabo speaks on January 27, 2022 at Democratic Action Party Of Kenya (DAP-K) Party Headquarters at Kilimani in Nairobi. [Edward Kiplimo,Standard]  Trans Nzoia Woman Rep Janet Nangabo has pulled out of the governor race to defend her seat after months of intense campaigns.  Ms Nangabo announced on Sunday that she had quit the contest for governor to concentrate on recapturing her seat.  Nangabo, who decamped from United Democratic Alliance (UDA) to DAP-Kenya, declared her support for former Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya.   During a DAP-Kenya rally at Kiminini Primary School, the county lawmaker said her decision to withdraw from the race followed consultations between her and Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.  “I’ve quit the governor race and embarked on campaigns to defend my seat. We’ve resolved to support Natembeya for the seat,” said Nangabo.  Maurice Bisau, an ally of Deputy President William Ruto, who has decamped to DAP-Kenya, has also abandoned his gubernatorial bid in favour of Natembeya and has declared interest in the Kiminini parliamentary seat.  The two made the announcement at Kiminini Primary School, where Mr Bisau launched his bid for the Kiminini parliamentary seat.  Mr Wamalwa welcomed the decision by the two to quit the race and support Natembeya.  The CS said combined efforts between Nangabo and Bisau would deliver the seat to DAP-Kenya.  “As a party, we welcome their gesture, and this signals a victory for Natembeya,” said Wamalwa.  At the same event, Murgon Juma, who unsuccessfully contested for Nabiswa Ward leadership in 2017, declared interest in the county’s senatorial seat.
