Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka. [File, Standard]  Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has denied reports that he has ditched Jubilee Party for Ford-Kenya.  Reports in a section of the media on Wednesday evening, February 16, stated that Lusaka had joined forces with Moses Wetang’ula.  The Speaker, however, says he only held a consultative meeting with the Ford-Kenya Party leader, and that he hadn’t announced his decision.  “I’m surprised that some of his (Wetang’ula’s) people are now going round claiming I have ditched Jubilee for Ford-Kenya. The deadline for declaring party membership is March 26. I will announce my decision on, or before then,” Lusaka told The Standard. “Right now, I’m meeting representatives from various political parties.”  Lusaka is eyeing the Bungoma governor seat in the August 9 polls.
