Devolution Principal Secretary Julius Kiplangat Kirui is facing assault charges.  The PS accused of assaulting his wife has been ordered to appear in court on Monday to take a plea.  The order was issued yesterday by Milimani Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi.  The summons were issued after the PS failed to turn up in court yesterday.  Through his lawyer, the PS informed the court that he was away on official duty in Tanzania attending an East African Community forum.  He urged the Court to allow his plea taking to be deferred. The State through senior State Prosecutor Everlyne Onunga did not object to the suspect's request.  Onunga urged the court to issue the last summon to Kirui to attend court failure to which a warrant of arrest should be issued.  Shitubi warned the PS to take court summons seriously. The PS is alleged to have assaulted his wife Evelyn Chepkorir Koech.     By Standard Team | 55 minutes ago By Kamau Muthoni | 55 minutes ago By Stevens Muendo | 3 hours ago By Wainaina Wambu | 9 hours ago
