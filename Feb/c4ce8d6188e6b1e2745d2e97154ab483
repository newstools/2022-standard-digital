The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) and the Global Peace Foundation have signed a partnership deal to promote peace ahead of the August 9 elections.  The Memorandum of Understanding signed on Wednesday will see the two organisations collaborate in various peace-building efforts including the promotion of a peaceful electoral process through the campaign dubbed 'Elections Bila Noma'.  The deal was signed by NCIC boss Dr Skitter Ocharo and Global Peace Foundation Country Director Daniel Juma Omondi.  They said the two organisations will also collaborate towards the realisation of the institutions’ other shared objectives such as promoting civic awareness and national values through civic education and other modes of advocacy and national reconciliation.   "The partnership opens a new area of strategic partnership between our two institutions. In this view, NCIC shall leverage on the strengths and comparative advantage of Global Peace Foundation Kenya to ensure the envisaged areas of partnership are fully implemented", said Ocharo.  The organisation’s Country Director Daniel Juma applauded NCIC on their commitment to national cohesion and the ongoing efforts to ensure peaceful elections and to avoid a repeat of political violence witnessed in the past.  As a part of the 'Elections Bila Noma' campaign, both organisations are scheduled to conduct training for political aspirants to enable them to conduct effective campaigns in the upcoming elections.     By Kennedy Gachuhi and Daniel Chege | 1 hour ago By Gardy Chacha | 3 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 3 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 3 hours ago
