Detectives in the county have launched investigations into the gruesome murder of the guard.  John Onyango, the County Criminal Investigations Officer, said the body of the 39-year-old guard with KKK Security Company was found Thursday morning.  He said detectives visited the scene after the company's chief security officer alerted his office that the body of one of their guards, who was off-duty at the time of the incident, had been found dumped at the company's property. "Preliminary investigations indicate that the guard died from a single stab wound which penetrated from the shoulder into the heart," said Mr Onyango.   He added that the scene-of-crime officers noted that the place where the body was found was a secondary location since there was no blood at the scene nor any sign of struggle.  "This means that the guard was killed elsewhere before the body was brought and dumped by the killers in the secondary scene," said Onyango.  He added: "We are trying to find the primary scene which will provide clues and forensic evidence which will help establish the motive."  The body was taken to Kericho County Hospital mortuary.
