Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) offices at the Integrity Centre in Nairobi. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has summoned 12 ward reps over alleged misappropriation of county funds in the last two years.  This is the period that saw Speaker Ndegwa Wahome impeached and later reinstated by the courts.  Among those set to appear before the anti-graft commission are Salome Gathoni, Mary Wanjau, Loise Wanna, Jane Nyambura, Georgina Chira and Geofrey Ngaruiya. Others are Wanjiku Muhoho, Margaret Wanjiru, Joseph Kariuki, Wangari Methu and Jecinta Wangari.  According to EACC Central Regional Manager Abraham Kemboi, they are expected to explain how and why they received certain payments worth millions of shillings.   “It is true that have summoned them to explain how they got the payments from the assembly which they cannot account for. They will separately appear before our officers in our Nyeri offices,” he said.  He said those who will be found guilty will face charges. “They have to account for every coin they received. The law must be followed,” said Kemboi.  The MCAs are among those who supported the impeachment of Speaker Wahome and are believed to be allies of Governor Francis Kimemia (left).
