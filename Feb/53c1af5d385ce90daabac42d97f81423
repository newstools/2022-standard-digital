He had been a trusted family friend who would transport the family’s seven-year-old minor to and from school every day in Kolwa Central in Kisumu County.  And the family had no reason to worry about the safety of their daughter, after all, their relatives and neighbours also knew John Nyangau, who had also doubled up as a water vendor. Little did they know that Mr Nyangau was secretly stealing the innocence of their child and had subjected her to defilement and mental torture.  They, however, began to become suspicious when the child refused to be taken to school by the boda boda operator and instead preferred to walk to school. Their worst fears were confirmed on April 18, 2018, when the child scribbled on a piece of paper that the convict had defiled her.  Yesterday, the High Court sitting in Kisumu confirmed the heinous character of the suspect and confirmed a life sentence he had been handed by the trial magistrate’s court that had found him guilty of the offense. Justice Jacquiline Kamau said guilt was proven and the suspect even apologised when he appeared at the trial court.
