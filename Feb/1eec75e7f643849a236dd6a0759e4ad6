L-R: Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, ODM leader Raila Odinga and Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has dismissed claims of his absence and inaction in the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) functions.  He on Friday evening said that he had spent the day attending party leader Raila Odinga’s presidential campaign board meeting in Nairobi.  “I urge Azimio supporters to ignore propaganda being spread by my detractors who are uncomfortable with Azimio wave sweeping the country and my firm stand behind Baba's bid for presidency,” he tweeted.  The ODM party, through its twitter handle, reiterated his remarks saying to treat the claims as just rumours. “Oparanya is a member of the Raila Campaign Board. The board has been meeting the whole afternoon and he [Oparanya] was in attendance,” ODM said.  Social media has been awash with speculations that Oparanya could be defecting camp.  The county chief in December 2021 disclosed to The Standard that Raila Odinga had all but one missing piece of the puzzle needed to secure him victory.  Oparanya said Raila lacked support of the “government and State machinery,” which he believes the ODM leader has achieved through the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta.     By Kennedy Gachuhi | 5 hours ago By Elvince Joshua | 9 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 12 hours ago By Erastus Mulwa | 14 hours ago
