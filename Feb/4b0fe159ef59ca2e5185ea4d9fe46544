Police in Kakamega are waiting for a post-mortem report to know whether a journalist whose body was found on Friday was killed or he died by suicide.  Kakamega police boss Hassan Barua said the body of long-serving sports correspondent Titus Maero had been moved to the county’s general hospital mortuary for autopsy.  “We can’t say whether it was suicide or he was murdered until the report by the doctors is done. We took the body from his Navakholo constituency home after processing the scene and will follow up after the report by medics is out,” he said.  The long-serving Nation Media Group sports correspondent was based in Kakamega Bureau.  Maero, 59, is alleged to have taken his life in his house at Lulonda village, Navakholo where he stayed alone. Police say a suicide note was found in the room.  His friends said he appeared to suffer from depression and stress as he was fighting cancer for 15 years.  “I was shocked with the news. That said, he (Maero) was a composed and hardworking scribe. His passion for sports writing can be compared to none. We have lost a polished writer,” said Benson Amadala, NMG Kakamega Bureau Chief.    By Brian Kisanji | 4 hours ago By Robert Amalemba | 15 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 15 hours ago By Nathan Ochunge | 22 hours ago
