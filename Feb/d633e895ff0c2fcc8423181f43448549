Fish trader sorts her catch at Kamere landing beach ahead of sale to the public. [Antony Gitonga, Standard]  Fish sales from Lake Naivasha and private ponds in Naivasha are expected to double by the end of this year once the multi-million shilling Naivasha smart fish market is complete.  The Sh230 million facility located in Karai, on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, is the only one of its kind in the region, and is expected to be complete by June.  The joint project between the Nakuru County government and the East African Green Council market comes as the former announced plans to restock Lake Naivasha.  According to Njoroge Gichuhi, the county's Chief of Staff, the market will transform the area and provide ready market for fish, minimising waste. Mr Gichuhi said the project would benefit more than 500 fish traders and tens of fish farmers.    Naivasha sub-County administrator Samuel Wamae said the market would reduce pressure on Lake Naivasha. He said job losses in hotels and flower farms caused by Covid-19 pandemic had pushed tens of youth into the lake. “We plan to restock the lake to get more fish in the market and offer job opportunities to youth who have relied on the lake,” he said.  Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairperson David Kilo said fishermen had suffered due to lack of a market. Mr Kilo urged the county government to hasten the process of reviewing fishing licenses locally to save more youth. “In the last couple of weeks, youth have suffered due to beatings from Coast Guards and its time this was addressed and law observed,” he said.  Area MCA Stanley Karanja said the market would also be of help to hundreds of vegetable farmers. “It will make this area the hub of fish trade and the benefits will trickle to other people, including hawkers and farmers,” he said.     By Irissheel Shanzu | 9 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 9 hours ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 16 hours ago By Martin Ndiema | 1 day ago
