Democratic Action Party of Kenya (DAP-K) says it has not struck any deal with parties in Azimio la Umoja to hold joint nominations under the movement.  Speaking at party headquarters in Nairobi yesterday while receiving defectors from ODM, Ford-Kenya and ANC, Secretary-General Eseli Simiyu said they had not signed any pact with Azimio on joint primaries. He said the party will field candidates in all elective seats. Dr Simiyu said the only agreement they have with Azimio is to back ODM leader Raila Odinga presidential bid.  “As much as we are in Azimio, we cannot purport to equal our membership to established parties like ODM and Jubilee,” he said. He, however, assured aspirants of free and fair nominations.  “Being a fairly new party, we are busy recruiting members. Joint nominations cannot be for us. We do not have a membership base to be able to us compete favorably with established parties,” Simiyu said. Defense Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said: “We want this party to be different from the rest and you can be rest assured that nominations will not be all about how much money you bring. No one will take the ticket from you because how much they can give.” The declaration by DAP-K could crash the dream of Azimio of having joint nominations.    Raila has in the past said coalition partners would try to strike a balance in picking flag bearers in certain regions. He said they will use consensus.  The ODM leader hinted that parties will be restricted from presenting aspirants for certain elective seats in favour of other outfits.   Already Jubilee and ODM officials are working on rules which will govern the nominations under Azimio.  It also emerged that a committee led by former Cabinet minister Noah Wekesha and Lugari MP Ayub Savula had been formed to lead DAP-K into negotiations with Azimio parties.
