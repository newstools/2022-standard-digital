Medical practitioners pushing a patient down a hospital corridor [Courtesy]  A cardinal responsibility of government is to build an educated, well-fed, healthy nation. In Kenya, that is hardly the case given the high cost of education, food commodities and healthcare.  As such, any action that seeks to lower these costs is welcome, such as Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe's move to put private hospitals on notice over exorbitant charges. Granted, private hospitals provide better healthcare services. That, however, is not enough reason to charge an arm and a leg. Ultimately, doing so defeats the purpose of universal health care.  Loopholes in the management of public hospitals and the National Health Insurance Fund have emboldened private hospitals to levy unrealistic charges. While they are entitled to make profit, and ours is a capitalist economy, it is illogical that private hospitals should charge many times what public hospitals do.    By Editorial | 7 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
