Members of the public with the police at the scene of the accident. [Antony Gitonga, Standard]  Four people believed to be members of the same family died today in a grisly road accident along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.  The four died on the spot after their Toyota Probox rammed into the rear of a truck ferrying construction materials near Kinungi Shopping Centre.  The three men and a woman were headed to Nairobi from Nakuru when the accident occurred on a hilly stretch, 15kms from Naivasha town.  The vehicle rammed into a truck at Kinungi centre. [Antony Gitonga, Standard] Witnesses at the scene blamed the accident on the driver of the ill-fated vehicle for speeding.  Confirming the incident, Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said a fifth passenger is in critical condition at Naivasha Sub-County Hospital.  "The four died on the spot and the other was seriously injured. The bodies have been taken to the mortuary while the vehicles were towed to the police station," said Waweru.   By Edward Kosut | 16 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 19 hours ago By Jacob Ngetich  | 23 hours ago By Obare Osinde | 1 day ago
