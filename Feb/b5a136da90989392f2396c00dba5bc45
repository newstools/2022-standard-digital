The phones belonged to Stanley Wambugu, owner of the shop. Munjaku was charged that on the same day at around 8pm at the same mall, he was found in possession of phones believed to be the ones stolen from Wambugu's shop.   Ondeke was also charged that on the same day, having been an employee of Gonad Security Company to guard the mall, failed to use reasonable means to prevent theft of the phones. The charge sheet read that Ondeke failed to prevent thieves from breaking into the shop.  They were each released on a bond of Sh200,000 or alternatively pay a cash bail of Sh100,000.   The case will be mentioned on March 1.     By Collins Kweyu | 1 hour ago By Lynn Kolongei | 14 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 1 day ago By Elvince Joshua | 3 days ago
