Silas Muriuki, August 30, 2017. [Peter Muthomi, Standard]  When the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declared Rahim Dawood the winner in the North Imenti parliamentary election in 2017, the former MP Silas Muriuki petitioned.  Mr Muriuki accused the electoral body of stealing his victory.  According to IEBC, Dawood garnered 29,042 votes against Muriuki’s 28,894. Their closest challenger, out of eight other candidates, was Rajesh Hirani with 3,950.  Muriuki sued IEBC, Dawood and the returning officer, arguing his votes had been stolen. But the High Court in Meru upheld Dawood’s election and ordered Muriuki to pay Sh1 million to the winner, IEBC and the returning officer.  Four years down the line, Muriuki is not mincing his words against what he termed as an injustice.  Muriuki says in addition to the Sh3 million costs he was slapped with, he spent another Sh3 million in legal fees.  “I lost trust in the electoral system. I lost trust in the Judiciary.  “It is very hurting. From the court process I spent Sh6 million” Muriuki says.  The 73-year-old former teacher, who now concentrates on his dairy farming venture, says he spent millions campaigning.   His daughter, Carol Muriuki, is gunning for the seat in this year’s election.  In Buuri constituency, Mugambi Angaine's (PNU) petition against Mugambi Rindikiri (Jubilee) was also dismissed.
