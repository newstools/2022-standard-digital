Family and friends mourn the death of Arnold Onyango in Rachuonyo North Sub-County. [James Omoro, Standard]  Grief has engulfed a village in Homa Bay County after a Grade Two pupil was killed by a crocodile in Lake Victoria.  Lower Kamuga Primary School pupil Master Arnold Onyango met his death at Kobiero beach in Rachuonyo North Sub-County on Sunday evening while bathing with two other children.  According to North Karachuonyo Ward Beach Management Unit (BMU) Chairperson Erick Osawa, the crocodile grabbed Onyango by the leg and dragged him underwater before resurfacing minutes later.  Efforts to free the pupil failed after it dived again and swam to the deeper end of the lake.  “The boy was bathing with his friends at the lakeshore when he was attacked. Villagers, who rushed to the scene, tried to locate the crocodile but they neither found it nor the boy’s body,” said Osawa.     Osawa called on government agencies to intervene and assist in the search.  “We call on well-wishers to intervene and help us look for the body,” said Osawa.  Confirming the incident, Kokoth Kataa chief Michael Owino said villagers are focussing on the lake's papyrus reeds.  “It is believed that the crocodile hide the body in the reeds. The search team is focusing on it to enhance chances of retrieving the body,” Owino said.   By Harold Odhiambo and Winfrey Owino | 16 hours ago By Mactilda Mbenywe | 1 day ago By Anne Atieno | 1 day ago By Anne Atieno | 3 days ago
