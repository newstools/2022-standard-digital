Nyaore was identified by DCI as the main suspect in the Forest Road incident. [Source; DCI, Facebook]  Zachariah Nyaora Obadia, the alleged mastermind behind the Forest Road incident, has been arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) attempting to illegally cross the border to Tanzania.  The DCI says the suspect had been engaging detectives in hide and seek games until his arrest a few minutes ago.  DCI announced on its official Facebook page the suspect was y airborne to Nairobi.  On Tuesday last week, detectives probing the incident identified Nyaore as the main suspect. “This is after undercover agents drawn from the elite Crime Research & Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) and DCI Nairobi Regional Headquarters, narrowed down on the suspect identified as Zachariah Nyaora Obadia,” DCI said.  In efforts to arrest the suspect, the detectives say they went to search for the suspect at Mukuru Kaiyaba slums.  “However, the suspect who is aware of the ongoing crackdown on errant Boda Boda riders escaped our dragnet by a whisker, via a sewer duct in the densely populated settlement,” DCI added.    Kenyans on social media took to various platforms to express their anger after a video of a young woman being harassed by a crowd of Boda Boda riders went viral.  Sixteen suspects were arrested and five motorcycles were impounded in connection with the attack on the motorist.  "Operations continue as we appeal for more information from the public," police say.  "I am shocked and disgusted by a viral video clip of a female motorist being molested by suspected Boda Boda riders along Wangari Maathai /Forest Road. We must protect our roads from such vile and reprehensible acts of aggression,” Interior CS Fred Matiang’I said.  Barely 24 hours later, President Uhuru Kenyatta reacted to the viral video.
