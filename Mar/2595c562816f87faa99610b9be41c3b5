[Courtesy, Twitter]  Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has congratulated Deputy President William Ruto for being nominated to fly the UDA ticket in the August 9 polls.  Mudavadi said it was commendable how the party members had shown solidarity with their party leader.  “Congratulations Mr deputy President. Your team has done a wonderful job and party members have stood for Kenyans and with Kenyans. Indeed, you have spoken well, spoken to our hearts, men and women of goodwill and for sure we have a partner in you,” said Mudavadi.   Mudavadi said he was happy with how the UDA and the entire Kenya Kwanza Alliance had expanded its territory by having more parties joining in.  “We are united because we want to see a transformation in the lives of our people, we want to restore the dignity of our nation, have access to affordable food and equal justice for all,” he said.  He added, “We are here to say that we stand in solidarity with the decision UDA has made in putting their best foot forward in you. We have had so many shortcomings by the current regime, but under Kenya Kwanza, we shall right all the wrongs.”  While advocating for equal utilization of resources, Mudavadi said President must be there to serve all the people and protect businesses.  “We want leaders who will not betray others. We want common grounds and policies on the economy and politics. We do not want a puppet regime with puppet leaders who are remote controlled but a leader who is hands-on,” said Mudavadi.  The former Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister said soon they shall unveil the Kenya Kwanza manifesto with confidence they will run the next government.
