[Getty Images]  Elly Kipkoech was on Monday arraigned before Chief Magistrate Dennis Mikoyan where he denied charges of defiling the class seven pupil.  According to the court documents, Kipkoech is said to have defiled the minor at Langas, Uasin Gishu County, two days ago.  Kipkoech also denied a second count of committing an indecent act with a child. Mikoyan directed that the soldier would be released from police custody on Sh100,000 bond, with an alternative cash bail of Sh50,000.  According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) the victim had on that fateful day arrived home late and reported to her mother about the unfortunate incident in which the officer allegedly held her hostage and defiled her.  The DCI noted that when the victim’s mother checked on her daughter, she noticed blood stains on her undergarments.  The mother had then pleaded with her daughter to reveal the identity of the assailant before reporting the matter at Langas police station.  The detectives are said to have arrested the officer from his hideout in an estate in Eldoret, placed him in custody before finally charging him in court.  The accused who is of the rank of Private underwent medical tests with the minor at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.  The medical results are expected to be used as crucial evidence during the trial.  The DCI also noted that sexual offences in the country have been on the rise while reiterating its commitment to bring perpetrators to face the law regardless of the position they hold in society.  The hearing of the case is scheduled for March 28, 2022.  By Julius Chepkwony | 3 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 3 hours ago
