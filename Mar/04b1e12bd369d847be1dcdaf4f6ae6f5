The American Government does not have the capacity to anticipate electoral fraud before it happens, a political delegation from Kenya heard this week.  This was in response to Deputy Prezzo Bill Ruto’s request for American intervention in forthcoming presidential polls.  “It’s a strange sort of request, to be honest,” a technocrat at the meeting said.  “If we had such capacity, we’d have applied it here two years ago,” the official chuckled.  “We’re flattered that you still think highly of our system, which has been in a shambles for a long time.” The official added that the US had two presidents at the same time, after the incumbent declined to leave office, just as Kenya, when Mr Raila Odinga declared to take power in a mock swearing as “the People’s President.”  Dr Ruto had a hard time when pressed to explain why he opted to seek a solution abroad, when he had the opportunity to solve the problem as the President’s deputy.  He could not explain either if his concerns are related to the current administration, which he still serves, or the one that will form after the polls.  “As a leader, I have taken the position to speak against any attempts to try and straightjacket people into predetermined outcomes. We would have expected to do this without the baggage of blackmail and intimidation that is going on but unfortunately that is where we are,” said Ruto said.  An American Governor said what Ruto was describing sounded like the application of algorithms to dupe voters into selecting the options picked by previous voters, a technology that’s not available in the US yet.  “It appears Kenya’s Silicon Savannah is much more advanced than we think. American techies are yet to deploy artificial intelligence in electoral processes. If it’s working for Kenya, that’s something Americans would love to replicate,” he said.
