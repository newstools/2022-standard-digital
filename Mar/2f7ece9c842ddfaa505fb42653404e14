Jimi Wanjigi addresses the press at Mash Park Hotel in Kisii County last year.[Sammy Omingo, Standard]  Businessman Jimi Wanjigi was yesterday questioned by the police over guns and ammunition he is said to be holding illegally.  The DCI last week summoned him, directing him to surrender 11 guns and 485 bullets.  He appeared before DCI Serious Crime Unit investigators and recorded statements. His lawyer Willis Otieno said Wanjigi was detained for close to five hours. On January 17, Wanjigi denied having any firearm without a licence. "The issue of the guns is being handled in court. My client does not possess any other guns," Otieno told The Standard on the phone.  DCI head of Serious Crime Unit Kuria Obadia on January 21 issued a 72-hour ultimatum to Wanjigi to present the guns and bullets. In a letter dated February 21, Obadia said DCI officers had learnt of a man who was armed at the Kwacha group of companies' offices in Westlands. Heavily armed DCI officers then raided Wanjigi’s house, claiming they were enforcing a warrant of arrest by a Nairobi court. Officers later learnt the armed man was an ex-Recce officer who worked as a bodyguard.       By James Munyeki | 1 hour ago By Caroline Chebet | 1 hour ago By Philip Mwakio | 1 hour ago By Lydiah Nyawira | 1 hour ago
