Marjan Hussein Marjan was confirmed as the new IEBC Chief Executive Officer. [David Njaaga, Standard]  The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has confirmed the appointment of Marjan Hussein Marjan as the Chief Executive Officer.  Marjan previously held the seat in acting capacity following the acrimonious exit of Ezra Chiloba from the commission in October 2018.  IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati said Marjan topped the interviews from a candidate population of five.  “The Commission congratulates Mr Marjan on his new appointment as the Commission’s Secretary/CEO of the IEBC,” said Wafula Chebukati. The vacancy was advertised in December, 2021, attracting 511 applicants after calls for applications ended on January 21, 2022.  Out of the 511 interested applicants, only five were shortlisted and interviews conducted on March 8, 2022.  Marjan overcame competition from Electoral and Governance Expert Zephaniah Aura, Mombasa County IEBC boss Nancy Kariuki, Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) Director Joel Mabonga and management expert Dr George Michugu.  Marjan will head the IEBC Secretariat that manages the day to day running of the Commission.  The Commission has nine directorates and 17 departments.  Each directorate is headed by a director, while each department has a manager.  The secretariat is composed of the following: the CEO, who is the Secretary of the Secretariat, two deputy Commission secretaries, nine directors, 24 managers, 47 county election managers and 290 constituency election coordinators.
