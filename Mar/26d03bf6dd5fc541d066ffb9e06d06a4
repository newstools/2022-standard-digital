Wajir County Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi Ali. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  The Ogaden Supreme Council yesterday endorsed the incumbent Wajir Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi Ali for a second term.  The council members cast their votes to choose between Ms Gedi and her political arch-rival Ms Nasri Sahal.    Gedi got 16 votes and Sahal 15 votes. Negotiated Democracy leadership has become the in-thing in picking leaders across the Northern Frontier District where clannism play a major role in electing the leaders.  In the region, elders sit down to choose amongst a number of aspirants who to have as their leader, and in most cases those rejected honour the choice of their rivals though in some cases others defy and go ahead to win the seats.  Ms Gedi who is the Chair of all the woman representatives caucus will be vying for the seat on a Jubilee party.  Gedi is also the Chair of the Jubilee Women's League.
