Diesel that spilled in Kanyamedha Estate, Kisumu Central on Friday, March 4, 2022. [Olivia Odhiambo, Standard]  The Sindendet-Kisumu fuel pipeline burst again on Saturday, March 5, a day after rupturing at midnight and spilling thousands of litres of diesel in the nearby Kanyamedha Estate.  Kisumu Central Sub-County Police Commander Tony Maina told The Standard that a heavy construction vehicle that was being operated on the site broke an already repaired pipeline, causing the diesel in transit to spill.  Police swiftly rushed to the scene and cordoned off the area to prevent residents from collecting the fuel.  The gush lasted slightly over 20 minutes, police said. As of the time of publishing this story, Kenya Pipeline Company technicians had contained the situation.  No casualties were reported.
