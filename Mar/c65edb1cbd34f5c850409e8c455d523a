Ford Kenya Moses Wetang'ula leading past Kenya Kwanza Alliance campaigns [Courtesy]  The Kenya Kwanza coalition has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM party leader Raila Odinga of lying to Kenyans that their 'Handshake' would be beneficial to the country.   Speaking in Garsen township, Tana River County yesterday, the team led by Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula asked Kenyans not to expect any improvement in the economy "when Sh11 trillion has been borrowed from foreign countries and the domestic market and needs to be repaid."  "Kenyans should expect the worst economy; there are no goodies from the cooperation between Kenyatta and Odinga. In fact, life will be more difficult for Kenyans," Mr Wetang'ula said.  He said Uhuru had maintained 'a studious silence' at a time when the prices of food, gas and other basic commodities were skyrocketing.  Tharaka Nithi Senator Kindiki Kithure asked President Kenyatta to emulate former President Mwai Kibaki and stop 'meddling' in politics. Prof Kindiki said it was wrong for Uhuru to be actively involved in politics after he had completed his term.        By Peterson Githaiga | 7 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 9 hours ago By Ndungu Gachane | 10 hours ago By Oscar Obonyo | 15 hours ago
