Visitors to Lake Naivasha pass next to one of the submerged structures near Karagita landing beach. [Antony Gitonga, Standard]  More than 50 per cent of structures around Lake Naivasha are on riparian land, an ongoing survey by the Lands ministry has shown.  Hotels, flower farms and private homes are among those said to have encroached on the land. The report has caused anxiety among residents, especially in Kihoto estate, which is home to hundreds of flower farm workers.  Kihoto was adversely affected by the rising waters from the lake last year and some of the displaced families have started to return.  A senior officer from the Survey department said they recorded massive encroachment by individuals and organisations. The officer said the first phase of identifying and putting up beacons is completed. “The homes, greenhouses, hotels and landing beaches are illegally constructed,” he said. Others are private schools, a police post and a dispensary.  However, Lakeview MCA Mr Simon Wanyoike said the landowners have valid title deeds issued by the same Lands ministry questioning them.     By Lynn Kolongei | 2 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 2 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 2 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 2 hours ago
