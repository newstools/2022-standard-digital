Wushumbu Ranch chairman Jimmy Mwamidi [Renson Mnyamwezi, Standard]  The World Wide Fund (WWF) has donated livestock worth more than Sh13 million to a ranch.  Mr Jimmy Mwamidi, chairperson of Wushumbu Ranch in Kasigau location, Voi Sub-County, said they received 210 goats, 51 sheep, 200 beehives and 500 poultry from WWF.
