He was presented before senior resident magistrate Renee Kitangwa.  He denied all the six charges related to assault and malicious damage to property. The suspect was also charged with assaulting Samuel Ramdas and Patrick Koech on the same night at the same hotel.     Mwaura faced another count of malicious damage to property.
