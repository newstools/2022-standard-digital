Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi [File, Standard]  Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has concluded a 21-day tour of the county, where he inspected development projects five months before he retires.  The tour that also saw him campaign for the Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) also earned the outfit some defectors.  The governor received defectors from ODM, UDA, KADU Asili and Amani National Congress among others.  They included Malindi parliamentary aspirants Mr Kenneth Karisa and Kadu Asili party leader Mr Gerald Thoya. Mr Kingi said elders would help decide on the suitable candidates for PAA, which has also launched campaigns in Kwale and Mombasa counties, what is seen as effort to rival ODM and UDA in the Coast region.  Nominated senator Ms Christine Zawadi and former Malindi MP Mr Willy Mtengo said PAA had gripped Kilifi and was spreading.    Ms Zawadi, who is eyeing the Kilifi woman rep seat, received Mr Karisa and Mr Thoya on behalf of Mr Kingi.   “PAA is a national party. We welcome everybody,” Ms Zawadi told the defectors and assured them of fair nominations.   By Jacob Ng’etich | 55 minutes ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 55 minutes ago By Victor Nzuma | 55 minutes ago By Brian Otieno | 55 minutes ago
