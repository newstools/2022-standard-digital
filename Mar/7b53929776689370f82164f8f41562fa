Devolution Principal Secretary Julius Kiplangat Kirui and his wife Evelyn Chepkorir Koech have agreed to settle their assault case out of court.  If they do not settle the matter within 30 days, Mr Kirui, who is allegedly accused of assaulting his wife, will be charged officially.  The PS' lawyer Victor Arika and his wife's Kemboi Kibet told the court that both parties had agreed to settle the matter within 30 days.  The PS failed to appear in court for the fourth time after he allegedly contracted Covid-19 while on an official duty in Tanzania last month.  He is alleged to have assaulted Koech at Ndalat Road in Karen, Nairobi, on September 17, 2020. Milimani Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi had on February 14 ordered that medical records presented in court indicating that the PS had contracted Covid-19 be verified.  Ms Shitubi ordered that a report on the medical documents be made on March 1.  The prosecution had earlier urged the court to issue last summons to the PS to attend court, failure to which a warrant of arrest should be issued.  This prompted the magistrate to warn the PS through his lawyers to take court matters seriously.  The case will be mentioned on April 4. If the couple will not have agreed, Kirui will be charged with assault.      By Paul Ogemba | 2 hours ago By Mercy Kahenda | 2 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 5 hours ago By Mactilda Mbenywe | 10 hours ago
