Deputy President William Ruto is welcomed by UDA Treasurer Omingo Magara at Tambacha Primary School, Kegogi in Kisii County last year. [Sammy Omingo, Standard]  Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu has termed former South Mugirango MP Omingo Magara's defection from the United Democratic Alliance is inconsequential.  Machogu said the party will conduct nominations to select flagbearers for the elective seats.  Speaking at Kisii Town yesterday after meeting with UDA officials from the nine constituencies in the county, Machogu said the party was committed to having the best candidate for each elective seat.  “The decision by some leaders to move out of UDA does not scare us at all. Nobody should expect a direct ticket,” said Machogu, who is vying for Kisii Governor seat.          By Kevin Ogutu | 3 hours ago By Obare Osinde | 4 hours ago By Muriithi Mugo | 4 hours ago By Ben Ahenda | 5 hours ago
