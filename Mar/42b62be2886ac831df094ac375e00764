A suspect linked to robbery at a bank in Kimilili, Bungoma County, has been arrested.  Bungoma North OCPD Apollo Busolo said the suspect has given information that will lead to arrest his accomplices.  “We are keen with the matter because two innocent officers and a bank manager at Ushirika Bank were shot and seriously injured and a substantive amount of money robbed,” he said.  He added: "The information doing rounds on some media sites to the effect that Sh25 million was lost is misleading because we are yet to get the exact details.”   The officer called for sobriety as the investigations continue, reassuring that the suspects involved would soon be brought to book.  "We are going on well with the investigations. All the three who were injured are receiving specialised treatment," he said.  Kennedy Khalakai, the manager of the bank, is nursing injuries at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret together with the two officers who confronted the robbers and sustained multiple gunshot wounds.  Police have released CCTV footage showing how cash stored in two reserves was carted away from the Ushirika Bank in less than 23 seconds.  At least Sh25 million was stolen by the armed robbers in the March 1 incident.  Eyewitnesses said the robbery occurred a few minutes past 1pm.  The footage shows two gun-toting men taking turns to cart away cash stored in grey steel boxes.  The robbers were armed with AK-47 rifles, with each holding the firearm in their right hand as they carried away the cash boxes in their left hands.  Their pace wasn’t fast, indicating the confidence they had while conducting the brazen robbery. That, perhaps, indicates the extent of police laxity in the area that has experienced a rise in crime cases of late.
