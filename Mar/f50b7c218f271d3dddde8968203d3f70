West Pokot Governor Professor John Lonyang'apuo. [David Njaaga, Standard]  Kenya Union Party leader John Lonyangapuo has criticised Deputy President William Ruto and his team for disrespecting the President.  The West Pokot governor on Monday said, "They must not abuse people who have not joined their party." He spoke during the swearing-in ceremony of three new executives who replaced those who resigned to vie for political seats.  The rift between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Dr Ruto has been widening, especially after the former endorsed Mr Odinga's State House bid.  Prof Lonyangapuo said it is wrong for Dr Ruto to disobey Mr Kenyatta, despite being his deputy for two terms. The KUP leader said the vote-rich North Rift region will vote for Mr Odinga.
