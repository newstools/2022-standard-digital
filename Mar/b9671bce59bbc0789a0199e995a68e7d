Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici. [Olivia Murithi, Standard]  Kirinyaga Woman Representative Ms Wangui Ngirici has called on politicians to protect their family units during the electioneering period.    Speaking in Gichugu, Kirinyaga County, Ms Ngirici appealed to Kenyans not to allow the driving of wedges between a husband and wife or even children due to political differences.  “We have family members who are supporting different candidates both national and county level, that should not be a reason to break the bond, we still need each other after August 9 elections,” she said.  She said that there are families and marriages that have disintegrated due to political competition, noting that the election cycle comes after every five years and should not degrade the values and moral fabric of the society.
