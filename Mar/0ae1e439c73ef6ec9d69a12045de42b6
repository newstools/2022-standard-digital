Five people have been arrested in connection with the death of a 45-year-old man whose body was retrieved from a shallow grave.  Police said the five are linked to the death of Stanley Sumukwo, whose body was found at Terenin in Baringo North.  Baringo North Sub-County police commander Fredrick Odinga said Sumukwo disappeared on February 19 and his body was found on February 28 when one of the suspects tipped the police.  His family had filed a missing person’s report and the investigations were underway.    By Julius Chepkwony | 10 hours ago By Osinde Obare | 10 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 10 hours ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 10 hours ago
