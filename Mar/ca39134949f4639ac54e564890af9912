The controversy surrounding an impending pre-election deal between ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has taken a fresh twist after Raila's troops asked Kalonzo to go slow on his demands.  The leaders faulted Kalonzo for taking "too long" to make a decision to work with Raila.  Kalonzo's hard stance has stalled talks of a possible reunion between between him and his long-term ally Raila. He has maintained that the ODM chief should back his bid based on the 2017 agreement the two signed.  Yesterday, however, Raila's troops threw subtle blows at Kalonzo over his demands saying he should make up his mind.  They were speaking in Nyamira during a rally to market Raila whom they claimed has the support of Kenyans to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.   Although they did not mention him by the name, they made indirect references to the Wiper leader saying those planning to join them should not put too much pressure on them.  Led by Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, the leaders claimed that Kalonzo was being illogical with his demands that has now stalled their reunion under Azimio coalition.  "We want those who want to join to come slowly without demands," said Kenneth.  Governor Anyang' Nyong'o also waded into the Kalonzo stalemate.  He said during the Handshake between Raila and Uhuru there was no "Kupita katikati" (passing in-between), a famous quote Kalonzo said in the 2007 elections.      By Oscar Obonyo | 6 hours ago By Anne Atieno and Caleb Kingwara | 9 hours ago By Allan Mungai | 15 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 17 hours ago
