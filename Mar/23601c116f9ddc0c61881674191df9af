The new Jubilee Party Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni (pictured) has warned MCAs who switched loyalty and paid nomination fees to contest on different parties.  He said the party will soon write to individual MCAs demanding explanations on why they were earning benefits yet they are no longer members of the parties that sponsored their election in 2017.  “Those elected on Jubilee and decided to switch parties should know they are no longer legally Jubilee MCAs.”  Many ward representatives in Mt Kenya have paid nomination fees to other parties, including Deputy President’s United Democratic Alliance, Mr Moses Kuria’s Chama Cha Kazi and Mr Mwangi Kiunjuri’s The Service Party, among others.  Mr Kioni said even if the MCAs continue drawing salaries and sitting allowances, the time will come when they will be required to account for the money they earned illegally.   He spoke in Nanyuki town during a meeting organised by leaders allied to Azimio La Umoja.   Raila Odinga campaign chairman and Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi, Jubilee elections director and Kieni MP Kanini Kega and former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga were present.  Mr Kioni went on: “You cannot continue drawing allowances from an office you resigned from. This is something the law does not allow. You will have to refund the money.”  He said the money may not be recovered from MCAs between now and August but the national government will pursue them for a refund.  “It doesn’t matter how long it will take. The state will still come after you.”     By Elvince Joshua | 13 minutes ago By Mercy Kahenda | 5 hours ago By Peter Muiruri | 5 hours ago By Elvince Joshua | 11 hours ago
