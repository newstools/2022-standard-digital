The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) will work with the media to ensure credibility and transparency in the August General Election.  IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati yesterday described the media as a major stakeholder in successful polls.  “We shall have a framework that will allow the media access to information and freedom to share it. We also expect the media to help point out breaches of the law and code of conduct for us to act on,” said Chebukati in Nakuru after signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Kenya Media Sector Working Group.  He explained that the polls will be conducted and results announced and transmitted in a transparent manner giving Kenyans a chance to do their own tallying.  “Results shall be reported at the polling stations and will be final. They will be made available to the candidates through their agents. They will be free to conduct parallel tallying. Each vote cast shall count,” he said. The IEBC, Kenya Union of Journalists (KUJ) and the Kenya Editors’ Guild (KEG) under the MoU committed to work closely in ensuring the public has access to factual information on the polls.  IEBC vice chair Juliana Cherera called on journalists to be factual, ethical and professional in their watchdog role saying that the media is the most available platform to showcase credibility and transparency.  “As an election management body we have an obligation for fair and verifiable polls,” said Cherera.      By Special Correspondent | 2 hours ago By Kamore Maina | 2 hours ago By Saada Hassan | 2 hours ago By Allan Mungai | 2 hours ago
