A suspect who has been on the run for two months after allegedly killing his girlfriend at Moi Ndabi village in Naivasha has been arrested.  Police officers tracked him using his mobile phone to an estate in Nairobi where he was arrested and taken to Naivasha Police Station. The woman was hit on the head with a blunt object and her assailant attempted to burn her body. The woman was last seen on January 30.  Her decomposing body was discovered by a farmer in a maize plantation a week later. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said initial investigations linked the suspect to the murder.  Meanwhile, two people, including a government officer, died in two road accidents on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The officer attached to the Public Health department died on the spot after his car collided with a lorry. In a separate incident, a woman was knocked and killed by a speeding car while crossing the road. The bodies were taken to a local mortuary.
