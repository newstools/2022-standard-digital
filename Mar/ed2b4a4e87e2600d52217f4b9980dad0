Ramaphosa did not say who had made the request or give more details on how he planned to work with the two sides.  "Based on our relations with the Russian Federation and as a member of BRICS, South Africa has been approached to play a mediation role," Ramaphosa said, referring to the emerging market group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

South Africa has also tended to punch above its weight diplomatically since its relatively peaceful transition to democracy in 1994.  Ramaphosa said in a statement on his LinkedIn page he had talked with Putin by phone.  "I outlined our position on the conflict ... as well as our belief that the conflict should be resolved through mediation and negotiation between the parties and - if need be - with the help of agencies that can help," Ramaphosa said.
