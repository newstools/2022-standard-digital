The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) will begin conducting its party primaries on Monday next week through to April 21, 2022.  The party’s National Elections Board (NEB) said the month-long exercise will take place in one or two counties at a time.  The board Chairperson Catherine Mumma has written to the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai requesting for security during the primaries, “to enable the exercise be conducted peacefully.”  ODM, in a circular, said they will communicate the different dates when the primaries will take place, along with polling and tally centres.  The Raila Odinga party has also requested Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha to grant them access to public schools, where the primaries will be held. Last month, ODM Deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya admitted that the party had a bad repute on how it carried out its nominations and assured that the National Elections Board had crafted fresh legislation to ensure free and fair exercise.  Oparanya held said the Azimio team would embrace consensus in cases where they have multiple aspirants against their opponents from Kenya Kwanza associated with DP William Ruto.  The position was also supported by Mumma who said fairness and transparency must be observed in the coalition primaries.
