A man who allegedly raped and killed a child in Dandora has claimed his life is in danger.  Timothy Thuo appeared before a Makadara court where the police sought more time to hold him.  Police Constable Collins Shivatse said on Tuesday, the three-year-old child was playing with others. She then left to go use the bathroom.  A caretaker, Macline Awino, later went to check on her after the child took more than half an hour. Awino, the child’s mother, and other neighbours then started a frantic search until 9pm when they reported the matter to the police. The court was told the child’s body and some of her belongings were found in Thuo’s house. Mr Shivatse said more evidence was found in Thuo’s house, some of which will be handed over to the government chemist for further analysis.  A post-mortem is yet to be conducted on the child’s body.  Mr Thuo said he has been threatened and would wish to be held at a different station.  Makadara Senior Resident Magistrate Lewis Gatheru said Thuo should be transferred to Buru Buru police station. The case will be mentioned on March 24.     By Kamau Muthoni | 1 hour ago By Samson Wire | 2 hours ago By Jacob Ngetich  | 13 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago
