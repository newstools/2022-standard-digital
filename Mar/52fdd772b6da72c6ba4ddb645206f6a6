Eldoret Water and Sewerage Company (Eldowas) has come up with an initiative of incorporating its customers in the fight against illegal connections.  Dubbed LindaMajiMtaani, the mechanism will see Eldowas officials team up with clients in addressing commercial and physical losses of water.  The company organised more than 150 cyclists who rode around Eldoret town, where residents were sensitised on the need to conserve water sources.  Peter Biwott, Eldowas managing director who also took part in the race said the weekend event is also aimed at protecting catchment areas to create sustainable cities that achieve universal coverage in water and sanitation.  This, Biwott noted, is in line with the United Nation’s Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on climate action. “We hope to conserve over 5,000 acres within our catchment areas through afforestation in the next three years,” Biwott said after the event in Eldoret town. He led the team of Eldowas across estates enlightening the community on the initiative and urging them to report illegal connections.     By Julius Chepkwony | 1 hour ago By Yvonne Chepkwony | 10 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 1 day ago By Osinde Obare | 1 day ago
