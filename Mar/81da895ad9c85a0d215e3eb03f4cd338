National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani’s United Party of Independence Alliance (UPIA) yesterday endorsed Raila Odinga's presidential bid.   Speaking at the party's National Delegates Congress (NDC)  at Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi, Yatani said the party decided to settle on Raila as he was the only candidate who knows the interests of the people from the North-Eastern region.  He added said that he will consolidate votes for Raila as they embark on aggressive grassroots campaigns in the North Eastern region.  The delegates passed the resolution in the presence of Raila and the party’s top officials said they are safe with him.  Raila, the ODM party leader and Azimio la Umoja coalition flag bearer, took the opportunity to thank the party leadership for believing in him saying he will bring victory to the Azimio movement.  The CS defended his move to engage President Uhuru Kenyatta for a unity pact saying it was in the interest of Kenyans. "What we did was to actualise the dream and the vision of our forefathers of having a united country," said Yatani.
