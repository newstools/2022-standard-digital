Agriculture and Livestock Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya speaking at a past event [Boniface Gikandi, Standard]  The State has warned of a possible hike in fertiliser prices as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.  Yesterday, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya told a parliamentary committee that the current high prices could go up further and that could affect Kenya’s food production.  The ministry said it requires about Sh31.8 billion to stabilise the prices while linking the current rate to global trends.  “Given the war in Russia and Ukraine, the prices could even go higher,” CS Munya told the committee chaired MP Silas Tiren. Further, Munya attributed the current high prices to the Covid-19 pandemic which has forced countries to reduce exports.    Munya made the remarks while responding to Molo MP Kimani Kuria who sought a statement on high cost of fertiliser in Kenya.  Farmers have been complaining of high cost of farm inputs, which has made cost of production to rise.  Lawmakers warned that Kenya risks experiencing acute food shortage if the prices are not lowered or stabilised.
