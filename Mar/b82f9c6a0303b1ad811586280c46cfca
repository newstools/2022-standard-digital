Man passes next to one of the power masts that has been erected by Ketraco engineers for electricity transmission from Olkaria to Kisumu. [Antony Gitonga, Standard]  Plans by government to supply cheaper electricity in Narok have hit a snag following vandalism of the 132kv power line from Olkaria, Naivasha.  The 63km line that was set to be completed in November last year has lost equipment worth more than Sh12 million since last August.   The vandals recently messed the power line in Narasha on the border of Narok and Naivasha, carting away over 3,000m of transmission cables.   According to Mr Gideon Mulwa of China Camse Engineering Company, the incident had a huge impact on the ongoing work. "Police should go for the mastermind," he said.    By Antony Gitonga | 45 minutes ago By Brian Kipkorir | 57 minutes ago By Julius Chepkwony | 1 hour ago By Ishreel Shanzu | 2 hours ago
