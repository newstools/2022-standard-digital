Police say they don’t have evidence against the 16 suspects. [File, Standard]  The Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi has freed 16 boda boda riders, who had been arrested over alleged sexual assault on a female motorist on Wangari Maathai Road, Nairobi.  The incident occurred on March 4 this year.  Police told the court on Monday, March 28, that they did not establish concrete evidence against the 16.  The Investigating Officer Lyvonne Mwanzia, however, stated that the key suspect in the assault, Zachariah Obadia, was awaiting arraignment after his investigations file was forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP). Obadia was later charged with three counts, including sexual assault, destruction of property and robbery with violence. He denied all the charges.  The court will rule on Thursday, March 31, whether Obadia will be granted bond, or not.
