Mutua now succeeds Milcah Kulati as the CEO of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK).  “The Board of Directors of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) is pleased to announce the appointment of Ezekiel Mutua as its Chief Executive Officer, effective Friday, March 25, 2022,” reads a statement by the MCSK Board chairperson Lazarus Muli.  Muli said Mutua emerged the best among the candidates interviewed for the MCSK top job.
