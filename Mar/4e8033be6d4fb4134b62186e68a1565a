KANU chairperson Gideon Moi, who is also the Senator for Baringo County. [File, Standard]  National debt management, free secondary education, sustainable economy, and affordable housing will top KANU’s agenda in the upcoming elections.  While unveiling the party’s manifesto at the Kabarnet Gardens in Nairobi on Wednesday, March 9, chairperson Gideon Moi said KANU will also champion food security and paying close attention to special interest groups.  Gideon further said fighting corruption, revamping agriculture and focusing on quality education for all will also be prioritised.  KANU is under the One Kenya Alliance (OKA), made up of Wiper Party, United Democratic Party, NARC-Kenya, among other parties. Gideon says KANU is currently in talks with Azimio la Umoja Movement for a possible coalition agreement.  The KANU boss, who is also the Baringo Senator, said Kenyans will experience a relief within five years, when it comes to debt management.  Protecting devolution, building infrastructure and providing universal healthcare also topped speeches in KANU’s manifesto launch.  “There are many special interest groups. Our women fall under that category. As a party, we won’t tolerate cases of gender-based violence like that one witnessed on Wangari Maathai Road recently,” said Gideon Moi.  Environmental conservation, promotion of green jobs, efficient transport, saving manufacturing, and tackling climate change also made it to the top of key priority areas for KANU.  Gideon Moi said he’d love to see a united country that has respect for the rule of law and integration.  “Ours is a commitment, not a promise. A commitment to look after the poor and marginalised,” he said.  On September 30, 2021, KANU’s National Delegates’ Conference endorsed Gideon Moi for President in an event held at the Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi.
