A Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) officer accused of defiling a 12-year-old girl has been released by the court on a cash bail of Sh50,000.  Elly Kipkoech was on Monday arraigned before Chief Magistrate Dennis Mikoyan where he denied charges of defiling the Class Seven pupil.  According to the court documents, Kipkoech is said to have defiled the minor at Langas, Uasin Gishu County, two days ago.  Kipkoech also denied a second count of committing an indecent act with a child. Mr Mikoyan directed that the soldier be released from police custody on Sh100,000 bond, with an alternative cash bail of Sh50,000.  According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) officials, the victim had on the fateful day arrived home late in the night and reported to her mother about the incident in which the officer allegedly held her hostage and defiled her.  The DCI officials said that when the woman checked on her daughter, she noticed blood stains on her undergarments.  The mother then pleaded with the girl to reveal the identity of the assailant before reporting the matter at Langas Police Station.  Detectives are said to have arrested the officer from his hideout in an estate in Eldoret and placed him in custody.  The accused and the minor both underwent medical tests at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. The results are expected to be used as evidence during the trial.  The hearing of the case is scheduled for March 28.  By Julius Chepkwony | 3 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 3 hours ago
