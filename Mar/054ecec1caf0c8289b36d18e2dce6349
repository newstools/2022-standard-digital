Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero. [File, Standard]  Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero says he is disappointed by the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party after it gave Gladys Wanga direct nomination in the Homa Bay governor race.  ODM leader Raila Odinga announced on Thursday afternoon, March 31, that the Party had issued a direct ticket to Wanga, who has teamed up with Oyugi Magwanga.  If elected on August 9, Magwanga will serve as Wanga’s deputy.  Kidero had expressed interest in the ODM ticket. The former Nairobi County chief says ODM’s decision to settle on the Homa Bay Woman Representative as the Party’s flag-bearer in Homa Bay gubernatorial contest has “denied the people of Homa Bay the opportunity to pick their preferred candidate under ODM”.  “I will explore other options. My commitment to serve Homa Bay people as their second governor won’t be deterred,” he told The Standard on phone.  It remains unclear what these “other options” are for Kidero, but the most probable one is running as an independent candidate in the upcoming elections.  The incumbent governor, Cyprian Awiti, is ineligible for re-election as he has served the maximum two-term limit.  The window for party-hopping was closed on March 26, 2022.
