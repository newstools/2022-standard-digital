Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has ordered dusk to dawn curfew in parts of Garissa County over increased land conflicts and criminal attacks.  The curfew, effective today, will start at 6.00 pm- 6.00 am, for 30 days.  Areas in Garissa Sub-county, Garissa central, Waberi East, Waberi West, and Iftin locations are the most affected.  “Incidents of criminal attacks fueled by conflicts over land and other resources have been reported in parts of Garissa. This has triggered retaliatory attacks, loss of life, destruction of property, and created tensions in the affected areas,” the CS said in a statement Wednesday. Matiang’i has also ordered the immediate suspension of land surveys, issuance of title deeds and transactions in the affected areas until further notice.  Administration officers and chiefs will be recruited and deployed to Tawakal and Bulla Mzuri areas to quell the situation.      By Bakari Ang’ela | 8 hours ago By Dennish Ochieng | 10 days ago By Bakari Angela | 10 days ago By Lydiah Nyawira | 14 days ago
