Atheists want prayers banned in secondary schools, claiming some students, against their will, are forced to attend church services.  In a letter to Education CS George Magoha, Atheists in Kenya Society (AKS) has asked the ministry to prohibit compulsory prayers and observation of religious practices in public schools.  The society says it wrote to Prof Magoha after numerous complaints it had received from students opposed to mandatory church services on Sunday.   “The most recent complaint was from a student at Kinjo Mixed Day Secondary School in Meru,” said AKS president Harrison Mumia, adding: “Based on Article 32..., organised mandatory prayer and religious observance in public school settings, whether in the classroom or at school-sponsored event, is unconstitutional."
