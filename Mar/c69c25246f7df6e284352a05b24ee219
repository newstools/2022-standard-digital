State House spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo [PSCU]  State House has denied reports circulating online that President Uhuru Kenyatta was scheduled to meet Central Kenya Jubilee MPs tomorrow (Friday, March 18).  State House spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo said in a statement that the President’s diary did not have such an engagement.  Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria had, on his Facebook page, listed 34 politicians allied to President Kenyatta, who had allegedly received invitations to the said-meeting at State House.  Kuria alleged that he had “accidentally” received the message, given he is not allied to Kenyatta’s Jubilee faction. Refuting reports on the said-convention, Dena said: "His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta's attention has been drawn to misleading information circulating online on a purported meeting with Central Kenya elected leaders this week.  "The President did not convene nor postpone any such meeting. Therefore, the information is false and misleading," said Dena in the press statement.  The now-fake message to MPs said Kenyatta was communicating postponement of the convention to a later date.  The Standard reached 11 of the 34 leaders mentioned on Kuria’s list, but none received our call or responded to our texts.
