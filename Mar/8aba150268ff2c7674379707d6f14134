Entrance to the Bungoma Referral Hospital [Duncan Ocholla, Standard]  As others danced to celebrate their success in Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations, Baraka Lister from Nambaya in Bungoma was in a hospital bed.  Having bagged 409 marks in the 2021 KCPE exams, she says, she was elated and wished to jump in excitement but she could not because of a broken leg.  The Bungoma DEB Primary candidate was involved in an accident on March 13, just after writing her final exam.  The boda boda she was on with her mother and younger brother collided with another. “We were coming from church when the accident occurred,” said Lister. She sustained a fracture in her left leg that warranted her a two-weeks stay at Bungoma County Referral Hospital where she has been receiving treatment.    Her mother had internal bleeding and was referred to St Luke Hospital in Eldoret for further examinations and treatment while her younger brother lost a toe.  Lister dreams of joining Mary Hill Girls’ School and later pursuing medicine.  “I have always dreamt of becoming a doctor to research in treating and eradicating health problems facing my county and the world at large,” she said.  Lister noted that were it not for her broken leg, she would be celebrating with her friends and teachers at school.  Her parents could not hide their joy as well.  Her father said he was really proud of his daughter’s performance as she has always been a top scorer since starting school.      By Robert Amalemba | 9 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 2 days ago By Omelo Juliet | 3 days ago By Robert Amalemba | 4 days ago
