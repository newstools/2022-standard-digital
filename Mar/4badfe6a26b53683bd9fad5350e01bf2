DCI headquarters, Kiambu Road. [Samson Wire, Standard]  The completion of an ultra-modern forensic laboratory at the DCI headquarters is a welcome move in the fight against serious crimes such as murder, rape and robbery with violence. However, this gain could easily be erased if the police service continues operating with the same mindset.  Issues such as corruption and police officers turning rogue against the people they are sworn to protect are still rife in the service and these may dilute this milestone that has been elusive since the 1990s. Even the assurance by DCI boss George Kinoti that the laboratory will be manned by highly qualified detectives is not a guarantee that the fight against these crimes will be beyond reproach. The Inspector General must therefore stand firm and rid the police service of rogue elements giving it a bad name.
