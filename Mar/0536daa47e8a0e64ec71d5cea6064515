Cliff Momanyi, the clinical officer who testified in the Sharon Otieno murder case on March 23, 2022. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  Cliff Momanyi, the clinical officer who went missing after testifying in Sharon Otieno murder case, has returned home.  His wife, Mary Kimaiga, told The Standard that Momanyi returned to their Gesusu home in Masaba South, Kisii County in the wee hours of Friday, March 25.  Momanyi had, on Wednesday, March 23, testified in court that he falsified medical records to show that Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s personal assistant, Michael Oyamo, was ailing during the period that Sharon Otieno was announced missing.  Otieno was, thereafter, found dead in a forest in Homa Bay County on September 3, 2018. Governor Obado and two others, including Oyamo, are facing murder charges in connection with Sharon Otieno’s death.  After testifying on Wednesday, Cliff Momanyi, the medic who wrote Oyamo’s “falsified” medical records, was reported missing, and his family filed a missing person’s report at the Kisii Central Police Station under the OB Number 54/23/3/2022.  His phone signal was last traced to Bomet on Wednesday evening before being reported missing.  However, on Friday morning, he returned to his Gesusu home, with his wife saying she’d established that Momanyi had gone to his parents’ home without informing her.  “He has refused to reveal where he was, or what made him cut off communication with us,” said Momanyi’s wife, Mary Kimaiga.  Momanyi is a clinical officer at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital.     By Daniel Chege | 15 minutes ago By Peter Muiruri | 5 hours ago By Ishaq Jumbe | 13 hours ago By Brian Otieno | 13 hours ago
