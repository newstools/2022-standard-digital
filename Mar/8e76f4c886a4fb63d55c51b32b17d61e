A truck fetching water from Saba Saba river, Murang'a [Boniface Gikandi, Standard]  Five water companies in Murang'a County have cut operations by 40 per cent following declining water levels due to prolonged drought.  The management of the five water firms have warned consumers to brace for water rationing.  At Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company production has dropped from 15,000m3 to below 7,000m3. “Our production has been severe in the past one week,” said MD Mr Daniel Ng’ang’a. At Murang’a South Water and Sanitation Company MD Ms Mary Nyaga said they were forced to tighten the rationing programme, and urged customers to use water sparingly.  Others affected are Kahuti, Gatanga and Gatamathi water companies.     By Lydiah Nyawira | 2 days ago By George Njunge | 2 days ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 2 days ago By Timothy Kariuki | 2 days ago
