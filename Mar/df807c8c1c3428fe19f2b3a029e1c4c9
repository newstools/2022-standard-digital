Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. [File, Standard]  Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has transferred two regional police bosses.  Titus Karuri, who has served as Central Kenya Regional Police Commander for the last one year, moves to Coast Region, where he will serve in the same capacity.  Karuri takes over from Manase Musyoka, who was the Coast Regional Police Commander since July 2021.  The two senior cops are the ones affected by the mini-reshuffle announced on Friday, March 18. Police spokesperson Bruno Shioso told The Standard that he could not comment on why the two were made to swap workstations.  The changes come 143 days before Kenya holds the general election.  As part of efforts to ensure security during the polls, IG Mutyambai proposed to the National Police Service Commission to extend, at least briefly, the contracts of senior police officers who would have attained the mandatory retirement age of 60.  Nearly ten senior police officers have been scheduled for retirement in June 2022.  The IG wants their contracts extended by another one year.  The National Police Service Commission is, however, yet to convene a meeting to deliberate on the IG’s proposal.  The commission’s chairperson Eliud Kinuthia told The Standard that where convinced, they can extend the expired contracts of senior officers.
