Young woman looking depressed [Courtesy]  A family is asking the government to help them to bring their loved one back from Saudi Arabia so that she can get medical attention.  Mr Kibibi Ali got a job as a domestic worker last year.  Her father Mr Ali Bakari said she called him asking for help to return home. “She said she could not access medical care and that she had no airfare.  That is why I am appealing to the government for help,” he said. Mr Bakari said the daughter recently underwent surgery after a growth was found in her womb. “The doctors recommended she be operated on, which led to the removal of the womb,” said Mr Bakari, adding that this was when her problems started.  “She was later dumped at the office of the recruiting agent in Saudi Arabia. It has been a nightmare for her and the entire family here at home.”  “Her first employer looked after her well but things changed when she was moved to the second home where she continued working as a maid. The second employer told her to pay house rent and take care of her medical bills. It became difficult for her.”     By Collins Kweyu | 8 hours ago By Willis Oketch | 8 hours ago By Tobias Chanji | 16 hours ago By Willis Oketch | 19 hours ago
