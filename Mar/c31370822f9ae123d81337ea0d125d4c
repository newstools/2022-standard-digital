KCSE papers at Iten Examination Container in Elgeyo Marakwet County on Monday,14, 2022. [Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  A police officer deployed to guard Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam candidates is said to have abandoned his duty station on Tuesday.  The officer at Koiban Secondary School in Nandi North instead went after brewers of illicit alcohol and demanded bribes.  He disappeared from the school compound at around noon. His colleagues later received reports that he had been locked in a house by irate residents who accused him of demanding bribes.  County Commissioner Herman Shambi said other officers were dispatched to rescue him. He will be detained at Kabiyet Police Station before being charged with neglecting duty.   Mr Gilbert Maiyo, a witness, said the officer went to the house of his neighbour Mr Emmanuel Kipkoech and demanded money.  “He was going around the village threatening to arrest those who refused to give him money,” Mr Maiyo said.  Residents detained him for close to an hour before his colleagues arrived.  Mr Shambi said a new officer will be deployed to man the exam centre.
