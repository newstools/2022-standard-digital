Some of the UDA aspirants from Nyeri County listen to UDA National Elections Board Chairman Anthony Mwaura. [Kibata Kihu, Standard]  Deputy President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) has decried harassment of its aspirants by the State ahead of the general election.  A statement from the UDA National Elections Board chairman, Anthony Mwaura, said there are ‘underhand illegal tactics’ being deployed by President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party.  He said the plans are meant to dissuade UDA aspirants from contesting.  Mr Mwaura said the deplorable acts are mainly in Mt Kenya, Kisii and Nyamira counties. He cited harassment of UDA aspirants eyeing governor, Senate, Woman Representative and MCA positions. He said Kirinyaga County has witnessed intimidation in form of arrests, accusations of tax evasion, trumped-up criminal charges and fake opinion polls.  “On March 9, Majority leader Mr Kamau Murango, the Kerugoya MCA and Senate aspirant, was arrested from his Embu home, driven to the Nairobi DCI headquarters and questioned until 2am.”  He was accused of forging documents in 2020, claims he denied. Mr Mwaura said Mr Murango was asked to report to the DCI once a week.  Mr Mwaura added that campaign billboards of UDA aspirants Aisha Jumwa, Susan Kihika, Cate Waruguru and Gathoni Wamuchomba were vandalised.  He said the choice to belong to a political party is protected by the law.
