Narc-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua announced on March 23, 2022 that she will support Raila Odinga’s presidential bid. [Standard]  NARC-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua has announced that she will support Raila Odinga for President in the August 9 General Election.  Karua made the announcement at Serena Hotel in Nairobi on Wednesday, March 23.  "I have chosen to be with Raila without struggle. We've been in the trenches together and from today we shall be going out to popularise the Azimio la Umoja coalition and his 10 point agenda," Karua said.  The NARC-Kenya Party boss also announced that she has formally exited the One Kenya Alliance (OKA). The function was attended by ODM leader Raila Odinga.  Karua said she’s decided to support Odinga because he has demonstrated leadership and selfless contribution to Kenya’s democracy.  “All sides of the political divide have people who looted [the country’s coffers] in the past. All sides have people who do not believe in the rule of law, and all sides have good people,” she said in her address.  “Nonetheless, I have identified a mass of good people in the Azimio la Umoja coalition,” she said.  Karua’s entry into the Azimio la Umoja camp means that all the OKA principals are now supporting Raila Odinga’s presidential bid.  The former principals of OKA, who have endorsed Raila for President, are Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper Party and Gideon Moi of KANU.  In his speech, while welcoming Karua to the Azimio camp on Wednesday, Raila Odinga said: “People who were together in the struggle [for multiparty democracy] are on my side.”  “I don’t think Karua [being one of the multiparty champions] had any other choice. The difference between Azimio la Umoja and the other political faction is akin to day and night or white and black,” said the ODM chief.
