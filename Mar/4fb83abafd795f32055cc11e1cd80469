A church official has warned that the huge number of street families in Naivasha poses a security threat.  Reverend Peter Aruya of the Seventh Day Adventist Church said they had noted an increase in drug use and prostitution after residents were made homeless after losing their jobs at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Rev Aruya was speaking during an event to mark Global Youth Day last week.  "We have decided to feed and clothe these families who have been forgotten by the society, leading them to engage in illegal vices," he said. Rev Aruya also said that while the church would not support any political formation during the General Election, they would not sit back and watch as young people were misused by politicians.
