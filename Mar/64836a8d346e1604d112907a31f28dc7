President Uhuru Kenyatta addresses a gathering at KICC. [Denish Ochieng, Standard]  President Uhuru Kenyatta has lauded Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s decision to shelve his presidential bid in support of Raila Odinga.  Uhuru, who spoke minutes after arriving at the Jacaranda grounds in Embakasi East Constituency said Kalonzo’s sacrifice will not be overlooked.  “It isn’t that Kalonzo was incapable. He is very capable of becoming president but decided to support his brother Raila.”  The Head of State, who has fully thrown his weight behind ODM leader Raila reiterated that only he [Raila] was capable of uniting the country and rid of hatred and corruption that has slowed development over the years. “Many doubted that myself and Raila could work together. All of us here today, we believe he is the person capable of moving us forward,” he noted.   He added that the declarations made at the Kenyatta International Convention Center (KICC) today were not to malign or start ‘wars’ with anyone.  “Hatuna chuki na mtu yeyote. (We are not in a fight with anyone),” Uhuru said, urging Kenyans to elect a sober leader come August 9.  Several governors and lawmakers allied to the Azimio Coalition are converged at Jacaranda grounds, together with supporters of Raila.   Earlier at KICC, at least 26 political parties including Wiper, Jubilee, ODM and KANU, signed a co-operation pact to support Raila Odinga’s presidential candidature in the August polls.     By Harold Odhiambo | 37 minutes ago By Patrick Vidija | 1 hour ago By Too Jared | 2 hours ago By Dennis Tarus | 3 hours ago
