The Commission on Administrative Justice (Ombudsman) will vet contestants ahead of the August General Election.  According to the CAJ Chairperson Florence Kajuju, the commission will work with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and other relevant authorities to ensure that only leaders who have credentials to hold public office vie.  "We are working together with these other bodies to vet these candidates once the members of the public raise issues with them. We will make sure that those who have tainted images are not cleared," she said.  Speaking in Nyahururu town during the opening of a regional office, Kajuju assured that the agency has the capacity to vet aspirants, and asked voters to raise integrity issues they may have against anyone seeking an elective seat.   The office will serve Laikipia, Baringo, Bomet, Nyeri, Nyandarua, Samburu and Nakuru counties, among others.    "Our office is determined to bring services closer to the people and that is why we have opted to open an office here," she said.  Nyahururu High Court judge Charles Kariuki said the office will help the courts resolve land disputes, murder cases and sexual offences, which are rampant in the region.  Laikipia Health CEC Rose Maitai, who represented Governor Ndiritu Muriithi, said besides holding public officers to account, the commission will help improve the county government's engagement and information sharing platforms.  She assured that the administration was committed to ensuring that the public accesses information.     By Paul Ogemba | 6 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 6 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 6 hours ago By James Munyeki | 6 hours ago
