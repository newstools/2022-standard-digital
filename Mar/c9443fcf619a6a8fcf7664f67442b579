United Nations Complex - Gigiri [Courtesy]  The war on terror has been boosted following the commissioning of a new counter-terrorism centre in Nairobi.  The United Nations Office of Counterterrorism (UNOCT) at the UN complex in Gigiri was commissioned yesterday at a ceremony attended by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i.  This facility will be available for use by security agencies in East Africa to among other things monitor terror activities within the region.  Counter-terrorism officials will use the new facility to train on ways to deal with terror. Matiang’i, who was the chief guest, said the centre will boost the fight against Al-Shabaab and counter violent extremism. “It will provide real time support to strengthen the efforts of the member states in countering terrorism,“ Matiang’i said.
