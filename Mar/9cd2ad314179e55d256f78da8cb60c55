West Pokot Governor Professor John Lonyang'apuo. [David Njaaga, Standard]  Initiation of joint development projects along county borders of warring communities in the North Rift will help curb incessant conflicts that has led to loss of lives.  West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said neighbouring counties and the National Government should consider investing more on education and economic projects, which he said, would be a permanent solution to insecurity.  The county boss said the projects would help tame banditry and cattle-rustling since the communities stand to reap the benefits of investment initiatives.  Governor Lonyangapuo said he has already rolled out development projects along the West Pokot –Trans-Nzoia border point to uplift the area that was for long marginalised because of insecurity. “We have built four schools, churches, roads and drilled water in this place. We have donated a generator to be used in farms for irrigation. We need to use funds from the national and county governments to heavily invest in education that will result in better livelihoods for all communities,” he said at Kapkasa area in Trans-Nzoia County while inspecting development projects.
