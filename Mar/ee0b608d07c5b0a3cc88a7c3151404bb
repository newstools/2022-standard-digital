Chief Justice Martha Koome has said the Judiciary will ensure the speedy determination of succession disputes.  She said this will ensure justice is not delayed, especially for needy families.  Justice Koome yesterday said the delays in addressing succession matters have caused many families distress and hurt their mental health.  Koome said her office will initiate a “rapid response” mechanism to ensure all matters are promptly concluded. “We will ensure families do not wait forever to have succession cases resolved,” said the CJ, who is also the president of the Supreme Court of Kenya.  She added that delays in the processing of succession matters further add to the pressure to clear the case backlog. Koome spoke at Kyumbi in Machakos County during a forum by Habitat for Humanity to build houses for the poor.    In marking 40 years of operation in Kenya, Habitat for Humanity built 40 houses for 40 families in Machakos, Laikipia, Homa Bay, and Tana River.  Koome laid the foundation stone of one of the houses, which she financed fully together with her family. The campaign is supported by individuals, the private sector, and international donors.  The beneficiaries are poor families that earn below Sh200 daily and households with no known source of stable income.  Frank Ireri, Habitat for Humanity Kenya boar chairman, said: “The Chief Justice has led by example, putting a smile on the face of a vulnerable family. We can all do it in a small way by buying a nail, iron sheets, or ultimately building a complete house.”  According to a 2019 World Bank survey, Kenya has an annual housing demand of 250,000 units with an estimated supply of 50,000 units. Only two per cent of formally constructed houses target low-income earners, the survey shows.  Ireri urged the government to subsidise the cost of construction materials.
