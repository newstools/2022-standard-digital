Impounded motorbikes at the Central Police station, Nairobi. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  Police will detain 16 boda boda operators arrested in connection with a woman’s assault.  They were arraigned yesterday after investigating officer Lyvonne Mwanzia asked the court to grant her 20 more days.  Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Mr Gilbert Shikwe said he was satisfied with the application. The prosecution supported the request to detain the suspects who will be held at Gigiri Police Station.  The suspects were arrested three days ago for allegedly assaulting Ms Tafadzwa Esnath, a Zimbabwean diplomat working with the World Food Programme. The crime is said to have been committed on March 4 at the junction of Limuru and Wangari Maathai road in Nairobi. Police are treating the incident as robbery with violence.  A video of Ms Esnath being harassed was captured on social media and went viral. She is seen being beaten by a mob at the scene and her dress is torn. Mwanzia said police are still looking for more suspects.    By Elvince Joshua | 13 minutes ago By Mercy Kahenda | 5 hours ago By Peter Muiruri | 5 hours ago By Elvince Joshua | 11 hours ago
