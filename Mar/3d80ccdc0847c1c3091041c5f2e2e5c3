Baringo South MP Charles Kamuren, William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Governor Stanley Kiptis and EALA MP Florence Jematia. [Harun Wathari, Standard]  Baringo leaders have put aside their political differences and vowed to find a lasting solution to insecurity.  This is as Form Four students start the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations today.  Speaking in Nakuru after a meeting, Baringo Governor Mr Stanley Kiptis urged the national government to offer security to candidates in Kipcherere in Baringo North, Yatya and Sibilo secondary schools, which border areas affected by insecurity.  The leaders said the heightened tension and continued raids by bandits might affect administration of the tests. Mr Kiptis announced that Baringo leaders had vowed to rest political activities for 10 days to. Six people killed by bandits were on Saturday buried in Mochongoi. Mr Kiptis, after a meeting with some local leaders, said: “We need the government to address this (insecurity) issue. People have been killed, others displaced by the bandits. Locals are living in fear.”  Elsewhere in Homa Bay, County Director of Education Ms Eunice Khaemba warned parents against being deceived to buy any “leaked” exams for their children. She said: “Let parents know that teachers have prepared the candidates to sit the exams.”  She said they had also put measures in place to prevent any form of examination leakage. “We have done our rehearsals and supervisors and security personnel have been deployed,” Khaemba said.  The county has 26,594 KCSE candidates for the 2021 examination.     By Daniel Chege | 3 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 12 hours ago By Bakari Ang’ela | 1 day ago By Julius Chepkwony | 2 days ago
