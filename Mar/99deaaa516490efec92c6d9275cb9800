An outside view of Homa Bay Police Station. [James Omoro, Standard]  A couple in Homa Bay was seriously injured when gangsters raided their M-Pesa shop and stole Sh250,000.  The operator and his wife were admitted to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital after the Tuesday night attack.  They were attacked when they were closing their shop at about 9 pm at the Homa Bay Bus Park.  It is reported that the gangsters first stabbed the man with a knife in the head. The wife who carried the money in a bag decided to run away after noticing them. But the gangsters pursued her.  The gangsters who were armed with guns shot in the air to scare away residents.  The gangsters snatched the bag containing the money from the woman before disappearing in a waiting vehicle.  Homa Bay Town senior chief Joshua Ochogo said the thugs stabbed the couple in the heads.  “The gangsters shot in the air to scare away residents during the incident,” Ochogo said.  He said the gangsters disappeared in one of the saloon cars they had used to access the M-Pesa shop.  But they abandoned one of the cars to escape the wrath of the public who were responding to cries from the victims.  Homa Bay County Directorate of Criminal Investigations Abed Kavoo said the abandoned car had been impounded.  “We have crucial leads which will enable us to apprehend the suspects,” Kavoo said.
