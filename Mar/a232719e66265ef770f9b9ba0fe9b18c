English KCSE papers early morning at Iten Examination Container in Elgeyo Marakwet County on Monday,14, 2022. [Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  A candidate refused to sit the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination after falling out with her father and a principal.  Security officers and Ministry of Education officials are still searching for the 19-year-old girl who stormed out of the school compound on Friday.   The girl had been lured to the school where the principal, Mr Kennedy Nyakundi, attempted to counsel her during rehearsals on Friday but failed.  Nyamira County Education Director Boniface Ouko claimed the girl insulted the principal and her father when they tried convincing her to sit the exam before walking out of the school compound. "She had dropped out of school and the administration was looking for her. When she was finally traced and successfully lured to school, she simply rebelled against the principal and her parents before rudely walking away," Mr Ouko said.  It could not be immediately established where the girl has been since she dropped out of school.  Mr Ouko said the girl was among a few other cases of absentee candidates who registered for the national examination but failed to sit the papers.  As the examination entered the second day Tuesday, two other candidates who had enrolled were missing from Riooga SDA Mixed School. A third one was unable to write the exam from her hospital bed at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital where he had been admitted for over two weeks.  And at St Kizito Nyansiongo Boys, one candidate's whereabouts remain unknown.    By Harold Odhiambo | 7 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 2 days ago
