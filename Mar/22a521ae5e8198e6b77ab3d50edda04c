The one-month exercise that will be carried out by the Department of Survey is meant to demarcate the lake's boundary at 1892.8m Above Sea Level (ASL).  The move comes at a time when private institutions and unscrupulous traders have encroached on riparian lands in the last couple of years.  According to a notice signed by acting Department of Survey Director Maritim Weldon, the demarcation will include staking out the 1892m contour line that defines the lake. “The surveyors will thereafter erect short pillars to define the line at an interval of 1km as part of the planned demarcation exercise,” read a notice from the department in part.  Naivasha Deputy County Commissioner Mutua Kisulu confirmed the exercise, noting that those who have encroached on riparian lands will be evicted. He said the work begins this week, adding that encroachment is one of the major challenges facing the lake.  “The survey will inform us if the flooded areas around Kihoto estate fall under the riparian land and the way forward on those illegally occupying it,” he said.  Lake Naivasha Water Resource Users Association Enock Kiminta welcomed the move.   By Bakari Angela | 16 seconds ago By Julius Chepkwony | 16 seconds ago By Daniel Chege | 3 hours ago By Benard Sanga | 7 hours ago
