Former Citizen Television news anchor Janet Mbugua. [File, Standard]  Former Citizen Television news anchor Janet Mbugua has rejected MP Moses Kuria’s offer to have her serve as Kiambu Deputy Governor should Kuria win the gubernatorial contest.  Kuria had taken to his social media pages, Facebook and Twitter, early Thursday, March 24 to reveal that Mbugua had refused to deputise him.  “I am shattered. After scoring the highest marks in the talent search for Kiambu Deputy Governor, Janet Mbugua will not be taking up the job due to unforeseen personal emergencies that she has to attend to in the immediate term,” said the Gatundu South MP.  Janet Mbugua now says she is not ready to venture into politics. “Thanks @HonMoses_Kuria for considering me capable to serve Kiambu County as Dep Gov. Indeed, active engagement in politics isn’t for me at the moment. I remain available in support of quality service to the good people of Kiambu and all of Kenya, more so vulnerable women and girls,” said Mbugua on Twitter.  Janet currently runs her Inua Dada Foundation, which aims to empower girls and young women.  Moses Kuria, who is the Chama Cha Kazi Party leader, is seeking to unseat James Nyoro as the Governor of Kiambu County in the August 9 General Election.  He has teamed up with Deputy President William Ruto under the Kenya Kwanza alliance.
