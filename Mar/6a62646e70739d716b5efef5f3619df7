Businessman Suleiman Shahbal. [Omondi Onyango, Standard]  Businessman Suleiman Shahbal has exuded confidence that he will bag the party ticket. Mr Shahbal, who is eyeing the Mombasa governor post, pledged to allocate more funds to the grassroots to spur development and attract investors.  He is in a tough competition with Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and deputy governor William Kingi.  Speaking at Kadongo Grounds in Kisauni yesterday, the businessman called for free and fair primaries.  He is set to hold rallies in Changamwe, Jomvu, Likoni and Mvita sub-counties in the race to succeed Governor Hassan Joho.   Apart from the three ODM aspirants for governor, the seat has also attracted Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo of Wiper, former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar of United Democratic Alliance and Mr Awiti Bollo of Vibrant Democratic Movement. Mr Shahbal (pictured) ditched Jubilee Party for ODM in June last year. He said it would be proper to have the residents decide who gets the ODM ticket for the Mombasa race, as opposed to boardroom party decisions. “We are ready for the nominations but we are demanding a free and fair exercise. The nominations should be decided by the people.”  Mr Shahbal was with Kisauni parliamentary aspirant Mr Rashid Bedzimba and Woman Representative hopeful Ms Amina Abdalla, among others.  Mr Shahbal said he will allocate more funds to the grassroots to spur development and create jobs.  He said each of the 30 wards will be allocated Sh50 million for various sectors, including bursaries.
