Don Bosco Gichana was attacked and injured by rowdy youths. [Sammy Omingo, Standard]  United Democratic Alliance aspirant in Kitutu Chache North Constituency, Kisii County, Don Bosco Gichana was attacked and injured by rowdy youths.  Mr Gichana, who spoke to journalists after reporting the incident at Rioma Police Station in Marani Sub-county yesterday, sustained injuries on his right hand. His Toyota V8 had its windscreen shattered.  The politician, who is allied to Deputy President William Ruto, said one of his aides was also injured on the head.  He accused one of his rivals of sponsoring the violence since he was afraid of his growing popularity. “It is absurd that a politician can use outdated methods to threaten me to quit the race for the Kitutu Chache North Constituency. Let him know that I am there to the end and I am ready to face him squarely at the ballot box,” said Mr Gichana.  Mr Gichana said he was leaving Monyerero after addressing residents when some youths pelted his convoy with stones. Several vehicles were damaged.  However, according to some residents, Gichana was attacked by angry members of the public who were annoyed that the politicians had kept them waiting for long only to address them briefly and leave.  “They walked away after a few minutes without giving people handouts,” said a source.
