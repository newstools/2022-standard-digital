CEO of the media council of Kenya David Omwoyo. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  The Media Council of Kenya has partnered with Kabarak University to streamline academic programmes through mentorship. Speaking while signing a memorandum of understanding, MCK Chief Executive David Omwoyo (pictured) said the partnership will benefit media students.  “This MoU will also enable us to deploy students to media houses to gain on-the-job skills,” Mr Omwoyo said. Through story writing and research grants, he added, students can write and report on topical issues which can help boost their skills.  “Media Council of Kenya has rolled out targeted short courses which media students can also undertake. These courses include election and climate change reporting,” Mr Omwoyo said.  Kabarak University Vice-Chancellor Henry Kiplagat said the deal provides a collaboration between the council and the university to promote mutual interests in expertise and knowledge. “The MoU will enable the university to involve MCK in the development and review of our programmes in media studies. “It will also provide a plan for both institutions to organise student and staff mentorship programmes, workshops and conferences,” Prof Kiplagat said.  Last year, MCK rolled out a programme targeting final-year journalism students across the country. In the programme, media and communication students were placed under a three-month paid internship within media houses.   The programme was launched by Information and Communication Technology Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru in September 2021.  “The aim is to bridge the gap of securing internships while giving students a platform to nurture skills and prepare for the job market,” Mr Omwoyo said.
