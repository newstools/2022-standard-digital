Deputy President William Ruto with Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper party leader) during the burial ceremony of Mama Rael Mbeleete Mailu, mother to the former Health Cabinet Secretary Dr Cleopa Kilonzo Mailu in Makindu, Makueni County in January 2020. [Courtesy]  Deputy President William Ruto is still courting Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka.  Yesterday, the DP returned to Kitui County for a second day in a row, saying he had not given up on working with Kalonzo.  Addressing crowds in Mwingi town, Ruto appealed to Kalonzo to consider joining his team, saying together, they can form the next government.  The DP blamed ODM Leader Raila Odinga for taking Kalonzo for a ride in the last two elections with a promise that he would support him for president. "Sasa huyu mzee wa kitendawili amezungusha Kalonzo mpaka juzi akasign makaratasi ambayo hajui (Raila has taken Kalonzo in circles for long, even recently he signed documents whose contents Kalonzo later admitted he knew nothing about," Ruto said.  Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki said as a neighbour of Kitui county, the onus was on him to look for and deliver Kalonzo to Kenya Kwanza Alliance.    Kindiki said he will make all efforts to convince Kalonzo to abandon Raila and his Azimio la Umoja movement.  "Are you sending me to Kalonzo? Shall I go and convince him to work with us?" Kindiki said.  And just like on Tuesday when he toured Kitui town, Ruto said his government would focus on creating jobs and opportunities for the youth, empowering farmers and small-scale traders through his bottom-up economic model.  Also present was UDA chairman Johnstone Muthama, among other leaders.
