Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Kanu chairman Gideon Moi have arrived at Gituri Primary School in Tharaka Nithi county for a full day Azimio campaigns. [Muriithi Mugo, Standard]  One Kenya Alliance principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi took the Azimio la Umoja political movement campaign to Tharaka Nithi County today.  Wiper leader Musyoka and Gideon, the Chairman of KANU and Baringo Senator, were accompanied by Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua, Tiaty MP William Kamket, Kitui Woman Rep Irene Kasalu and others when they met residents in different areas of the three constituencies.  Kalonzo officially welcomed Tharaka Nithi Deputy Governer Francis Kagwima who has parted company with Governor Muthomi Njuki and will challenge him for the seat on a Wiper ticket.  Endorsing Kagwima for the seat, Kalonzo told voters to elect Raila. He said he, Gideon and others had decided to shelve their interests so that they could be part of the next government under Raila.  "I want Tharaka (Nithi) and Kamba to be part of it. I will work with Kagwima to bring Tharaka and Kamba together because we are one," said Musyoka.  He added that having been part of the Tharaka by virtue of family and friendships forged over the years, he understands their challenges which include lack of water, title deeds, cereals depot and infrastructure.  Kalonzo also said he and Gideon will work to also ensure residents get title deeds.  Gideon pleaded with residents to vote wisely in the August election, saying they will be voting to curb corruption and impunity to ensure Kenya got good leadership.
