Armed robbers raid Ushirika Bank in Kimilili, steal farmers’ Sh25m [File, Standard]  A gang on Tuesday attacked a vehicle transporting Sh25 million and stole the money.  The robbers struck at the bank entrance in Kimilili.  The incident occurred as tens of coffee farmers waited at Ushirika Bank to receive their dues. The robbers shot at the bank manager and the two officers escorting the vehicle. Resident Barasa Simiyu said the attackers appeared to have been trailing the vehicle transporting the money. “About five bullets were fired yet no police officer responded. They came much later when the attackers had left,” Simiyu added. Those injured were identified as police officers Joseph Lomulen and Boniface Hamisi and bank manager Kennedy Khalakai.  Kimilili police boss Mwita Maroa said: “The attackers shot at the officers and took their firearms which they abandoned at the bank’s main gate.”  Bungoma North OCPD Apollo Busolo said one suspect has been arrested and is helping police with the investigation.    Simiyu said there has been an increase in criminal cases. “In the last couple of weeks, five people have been killed. The police are doing nothing,” he added. “We want the officers reshuffled because they have failed.”  Resident Pauline Ouma also attributed insecurity to police laxity.  “The robbers took their time to leave the bank and drive all the way to Chwele but there were no police officers to deal with them,” she said.  MP Didmas Barasa said the police should not focus on chang’aa brewers and ignore the serious criminals.   By Nathan Ochunge | 1 hour ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 hour ago By Robert Amalemba | 11 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 13 hours ago
