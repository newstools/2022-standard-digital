Boda boda riders and youth in Kisumu have received training on early warning, response and non-violent agitation to political issues in preparation for the August 9 General Election.  Champions of Peace programme director Elly Opondo said the training, which was done in partnership with the Mercy Corps, was important to enhance peaceful co-existence towards the election.  “From this platform, the group is able to update what they see during this electioneering period. The information is relayed to the police," said Opondo, noting that politicians often use boda boda riders and youth to cause violence.  Kisumu Central Deputy County Commissioner Hussein Alaso said it was important to deploy the youth and riders as peace ambassadors.   By James Omoro | 1 day ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By Harold Odhiambo | 1 day ago By Stanley Ongwae | 1 day ago
