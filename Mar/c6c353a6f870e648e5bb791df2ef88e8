Two motorists were Friday caught on video driving recklessly on the Thika Superhighway.  The video clip first posted by Facebook user Betty Kathungu-Furet attracted uproar on social media a better part of Friday, with Kenyans imploring upon police and officers from the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) to begin investigations into the incident and arrest the culprits.  The video showed two Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) being dangerously driven just after Juja, on the stretch between Kenol and Thika on the Thika Superhighway.  The matatu drivers are seen interchanging lanes dangerously, swerving from left to right, without caring for motorists behind them.  The occupants of the vehicles are also seen hanging off from the sides, in a shouting match, all while exchanging fist bumps and waves. Those visible in the now-viral video clip are clad in yellow shirts.  According to an eye-witness account, “the occupants looked like they were on a campaign trail.”  At the time of publishing, Juja Base Commander George Muriithi said he couldn't respond about the incident.  "I’m not in a position to make a comment on the incident today,” he told The Standard on phone.  Several Facebook users commented on the video, calling for speedy action from authorities.  Vicky K Kemama said: “The other road users are also in danger.”  Wanjiku Muhoho wrote: “The stupidity and arrogance.
