ODM leader Raila Odinga yesterday held talks with United Kingdom’s Minister of Armed Forces James Heappey.  On his social media handles, Raila said the two discussed defence and security.  “The UK has been one of Kenya’s most loyal and dependable defence and security partners. We had a robust discussion on enhancing our ties moving into the future,” Mr Odinga posted.  The former Prime Minister was in the company of Kenya’s High Commissioner to the UK Manoah Esipisu. The Azimio la Umoja Movement presidential flagbearer was yesterday scheduled to meet Theo Clark, the UK Prime Minister’s Trade envoy to Kenya.  Mr Odinga is on a five-day tour of the UK, days after Deputy President William Ruto also toured the nation.   His entourage includes governors Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Suna East MP Junet Mohamed and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth. Joho and Junet arrived in the UK yesterday.  Mr Odinga is today expected to meet Lord Tarif Ahmad, the UK Minister for South Asia, North Africa, the United Nations, and the Commonwealth at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.  He will also deliver a talk at the Chatham House on his vision for Kenya and also have engagements on Kenya’s democracy.  Tomorrow, Mr Odinga will meet Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at Lambeth Palace before winding up his tour by meeting Kenyans in the UK later in the day. He is set to popularise his candidacy in the forthcoming elections and sell Azimio’s vision.  Dr Ruto was in the US and the UK for 10 days, where he accused the Jubilee government of abetting corruption and not taming the looting of public funds.
