The assault video was recorded on Bunyala Road, Nairobi on Thursday, March 17, 2022. [Picture screengrab]  A Nairobi-based boda boda rider, who punched a police officer in the head on Thursday, March 17, has been arrested.  The suspect attacked the police officer, who was clearing an accident scene on Bunyala Road. The accident, which occurred in the evening, involved a motorcycle and a private vehicle.  A one-minute video clip circulating on social media shows the suspect, dressed in a pair of jeans trousers, a red jumper and sneakers, approaching the police officer and warning him against encouraging on-site reconciliation.  He is heard saying: “Hakuna kusameheana hapa (There’s nothing like forgiveness where accidents are involved).” He, thereafter, punches the policeman in the head. The visibly shocked police officer is heard saying: “Ala! Unanipiga (You’ve just beaten me up)?”  Immediately, other boda boda riders, including the one who was involved in the accident, pursued the suspect and handed him over to police.  The video shows several police officers in uniform handcuffing the suspect and bundling him into a police van.  “He’s beating up a police officer, yet he wasn't even a party in the accident,” a police officer is heard saying.  Boda boda riders at the scene faulted their colleague’s behaviour, with one of them heard saying: “These are the kind of people who ruin our reputation [as boda boda operators].”  The Standard understands the suspect was taken to Central Police Station, where he spent Thursday night.  He is expected to be arraigned for assault and obstructing a police officer from executing his duties, contrary to section 103 (a) of the National Police Service Act.
