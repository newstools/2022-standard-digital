GTAP secretary for education Ruth Wangui, Kajiado North MP Aspirant Anita Soina, National Elections Board member Florence Machio and other party officials address the press in Nairobi yesterday. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  The Green Thinking Action Party (GTAP) has waived nomination fees for women aspirants seeking elective posts for the 2022 General Election.  A move the party leadership says will give be an open window for as many women as possible to come out and vie for various elective seats and increase the number of women in political leadership.  Yesterday, the party also received a defector from UDA and maintained that it would empower women and seek to minimise violence meted against women mainly during party primaries.  The defector, 22-year-old Anita Soina, who is vying for Kajiado North MP seat, said GTAP had the interests of wome at heart and seeks their growth across the country. She urged more women to come up and vie for seats under the party and not allow to be discriminated against.   “Namibia and South Africa have previously elected Emma Theophilus at the age of 23 and Itumeleng Ntsube at the age of 21 respectively and this is proof that young people are not too young to lead,” said Anita.  The party targets to field 500 candidates during the August 9 polls and is confident of attracting the best candidates from all counties, especially women and youth.  “The Constitution guarantees equitable opportunities to all Kenyans regardless of background, ethnicity, race, social status, and gender. However, the political structure over the years has been skewed to favour men and those of wealthy backgrounds due to the influence of money in Kenya’s politics today," said party leader Isaac Kalua.  He said GTAP would seek to empower women leaders and the Kenyan households at large.
