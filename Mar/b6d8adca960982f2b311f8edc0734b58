Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Prime Minister Denys Shmygal attend a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa in Kyiv, Ukraine March 15, 2022. [Reuters]  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday called for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow, saying Russia would otherwise need generations to recover from losses suffered during the war.  Zelenskiy said Ukraine had always offered solutions for peace and wanted meaningful and honest negotiations on peace and security, without delay.  "I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk," he said in a video address released in the early hours of Saturday.  "The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover." The two sides have been involved in talks for weeks with no sign of a breakthrough.  Zelenskiy said Russian forces were deliberately blocking the supply of humanitarian supplies to cities under attack.  "This is a deliberate tactic ... This is a war crime and they will answer for it, 100%," he said.  Zelenskiy said there was no information about how many people had died after a theatre in the city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, was struck on Wednesday. More than 130 people had been rescued so far, he said.  By Reuters | 12 hours ago By Reuters | 1 day ago By Reuters | 3 days ago By Betty Njeru | 3 days ago
