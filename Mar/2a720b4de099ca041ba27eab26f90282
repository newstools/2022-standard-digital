High Court judge Beatrice Thuranira Jaden [Courtesy]  High Court judge Beatrice Thuranira Jaden is dead, Judiciary has confirmed.  Judge Thuranira is said to have passed on yesterday while receiving treatment in India.  She was among the 28 judges appointed by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) in August 2011, as the body sought to clear case backlogs.  She joined the Judiciary as a District Magistrate in 1987 and served in several stations for 20 years. She was then promoted to Judge of the High Court on August 23, 2011.   She commenced her tour of duty at the Kakamega High Court and served for two years before she was posted to the Machakos High Court and most recently the Civil Division of the High Court.   “Justice Jaden was diligent, hardworking and demonstrated exceptional commitment to her work. Colleagues who worked with her describe her as collegial, one who had a calming effect on others as she always brought quiet wisdom to every bench discussion,” read a statement from the Judiciary.   Chief Justice Martha Komme describes Justice Jaden as a person with a “warm personality”, who always had a smile and a listening ear to her colleagues.  They graduated together from Law School in the Law Class of 1987.   “Beside her professional life, Lady Justice Jaden was also a wonderful mother to her three children and many others whom she supported from the extended family and those in need. Indeed, Lady Justice Jaden is the description of a virtuous woman who is aptly described in the Book of Proverbs 31. Her death is a loss not only to the Judiciary fraternity but to the people of Kenya whom she served with humility, dedication and competence,” Koome said.   By Mbugua Ng'ang'a | 4 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 4 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 4 hours ago By James Wanzala | 4 hours ago
