Former Nyeri Governor Samuel Wamaathai. [Mose Sammy, Standard]  Former Nyeri Governor Samuel Wamaathai has announced he is supporting The New Democrats (TND) party leader Thuo Mathenge for the governor's seat come August 9, 2022.  Speaking during a TND aspirants meeting in Nyeri town, Wamaathai, who succeeded the county's first governor Nderitu Gachagua, said he signed a memorandum of understanding with Mathenge in 2017.  "I intend to keep my word and offer my full support to the party leader which includes me opting out of the 2022 race," said Wamaathai.  Party insiders claim the former governor, who came second after Patrick Wahome Gakuru in 2017, will be seeking the Nyeri town parliamentary seat on a TND ticket. Gakuru died in a road accident in November 2017.  According to Mathenge, the party is targeting 50 MPs in the August elections. "Nobody will be able to form the government without us," said Mathenge.  Mathenge said the party will only seek a post-election coalition and is keeping off both Azimio and Kenya Kwanza coalitions, for now.  Among those in attendance was TND deputy leader Jimmy Kibaki and chairman, Vicky Onderi.
