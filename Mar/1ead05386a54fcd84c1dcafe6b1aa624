Embattled Homa Bay County Assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo [James Omoro, Standard]  Homa Bay County Assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo has been impeached over allegations of abuse of office.  Ms Ayoo was impeached by 49 MCAs. The members also accused her of gross misconduct, violation of the Constitution and incompetence.  This was the second time Ms Ayoo was being impeached since the 2017 General Election.  She was first outed in November 2018 over claims of poor leadership. But Ms Ayoo, who has had a frosty relationship with a number of MCAs, went to court and was reinstated.    While moving the Motion on Tuesday, Kibiri MCA Micheal Odira accused the speaker of attempting to change the composition of the Assembly Service Board without the approval of the assembly as required by law.  Ms Ayoo is accused of violating the Leadership and Integrity Act. “The Speaker is expected to demonstrate honesty and should not engage in any form of misconduct,” said Mr Odira.  The assembly was told that Ayoo failed to carry out her duties with impartiality and objectivity.  “I want to tell this House that the Speaker engaged in gross misconduct by nullifying certain decisions passed by MCAs and those of the Assembly Service Board,” he said.  Her deputy Elyas Orondo took over in acting capacity until a new Speaker is elected.
