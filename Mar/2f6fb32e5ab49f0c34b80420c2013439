ODM leader Raila Odinga attending a meeting with the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) [Twitter]  ODM leader Raila Odinga says he is “unaware” of reports that some leaders, including himself, were planning to impeach President Uhuru Kenyatta after 2017 polls.  After meeting UASU representatives at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Foundation on Kiambere Road, Nairobi on Tuesday, March 29, the former prime minister, who was walking to his car, told Citizen Television that he was equally surprised by the reports.  "I am not aware about those claims. So, I have nothing to say. I don't want to get involved," he said.  During a meeting with the Mt. Kenya Council of Elders caucus on Saturday, March 26, the president reportedly said he severed ties with his deputy, William Ruto, after the DP allegedly plotted to have him impeached. "The president told us that Ruto was going behind his back, planning how he could close ranks with Raila to impeach him at an appropriate time," Mathioya MP Peter Kimari told The Standard.  Ruto has since refuted the allegations, saying he’s “not a mad man, or a fool” to bring down the same government he helped build.
