Two people suspected to be members of a gang in Kisauni, Mombasa County, were yesterday shot dead by the police.  They were killed at dawn in Junda Beach after defying an order by the police to stop. Police boss Juma Londo said, "The suspects were shot but their accomplices escaped. They attacked some residents with machetes before the police caught up with them."  Boda boda riders who witnessed the incident alerted the police after the gang attacked traders headed to Kongowea market.  Londo appealed to residents to volunteer information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects who escaped. “They move in groups of around 20 and attack traders headed to Kongowea market," one of the boda boda riders said. Another rider said he was almost attacked by the gang before the police arrived and shot the two suspects. The rider said the gang is relatively new. A different gang that comprised youth aged between 20 and 16 was contained two years ago.   Londo said crime cases increase when schools close.
