Benjamin Wanguba prepares his farm ready to plant soya beans seeds in Emuberil Mumias East, Kakamega County. [Courtesy]  Kenya Seed Company has flagged off consignments of seeds to various parts of the country as it seeks to ensure adequate supply of quality seeds during the planting season.  Speaking at the company’s headquarters in Kitale after flagging off trucks ferrying Sh100 million worth of seeds to West Pokot, head of corporate affairs Mr Sammy Chepsiror assured farmers of enough seeds at affordable prices.  Mr Chepsiror observed that drought-resistant varieties produced for the semi-arid regions that include West Pokot, Turkana and East Baringo among others would ensure increased food production.  “We are ready for the season and this week we will be flagging off seed consignments to different regions. I want to assure farmers that they will get all varieties we produce at their nearest stockists,” he disclosed. Recently, the company Managing Director Mr Fred Oloibe in a meeting with West Pokot Governor Prof John Lonyangapuo expressed interest in transforming areas that were viewed as less productive.  He observed that Asal regions have the potential to feed themselves if stakeholders support irrigation agriculture.
