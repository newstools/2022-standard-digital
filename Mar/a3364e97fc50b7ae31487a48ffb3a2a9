Safina Party flagbearer Jimi Wanjigi. Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Safina party has given businessman Jimi Wanjigi the nod to contest for the presidency on its ticket.  The party’s National Executive Council (NEC) stated that they had received a “written expression of interest” from Mr Wanjigi to be the party's presidential flagbearer.    “NEC resolves to propose for ratification by the delegates the name of Jimi Richard Wanjigi to be the party’s presidential flagbearer for the 2022 presidential elections,” said Safina Secretary-General John Wamagata. The party’s Special Delegates Conference will take place on March 21 with the NEC encouraging the party leader (Mr Paul Muite) and the presidential candidate, “to engage with other like-minded parties to negotiate an alliance".
