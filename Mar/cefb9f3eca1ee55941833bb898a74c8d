FIFA on Thursday ratified the suspension of the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) following a landslide poll by the FIFA Council Members.  FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed that the suspension will be lifted immediately after Kenya reinstates the ousted Football Kenya Federation which was disbanded by the government on grounds of misappropriation of funds.   A total of 198 FIFA Member Associations voted in favour of Kenya being suspended while only a single member voted for the country to avoid the suspension.  The suspension remains indefinite as it will be lifted once the Football Kenya Federation Caretaker Committee is ousted and the previous FKF regime reinstated in office. "The FIFA council suspended Kenya on February 24th with immediate effect due to third party interference in particular the take over of football by a Caretaker Committee appointed by the government which is a serious violation of the FIFA statutes.  "It is therefore recommended that the Congress confirms the suspension of the Football Kenya Federation enabling the council to lift the suspension immediately and as soon as the pertinent requirements have been fulfilled," said Infantino.  Zimbabwe and Pakistan join Kenya on the suspension list.  By Sidney Odero | 52 minutes ago By  Ernest Ndunda | 1 day ago By Ben Ahenda | 1 day ago By Ochieng Oyugi | 1 day ago
