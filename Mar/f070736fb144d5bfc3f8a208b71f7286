[Courtesy]  Politicians have been warned to shun hate speech and inciteful remarks as State agencies step up efforts to enhance peace during the elections.  Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said hate speech has remained a key cause of election-related violence, and that 51 cases were under investigations. The cases, he added, were reported between April last year and this month.  “Unfortunately, some of these inciting statements are made by leaders with little care to the impact of the utterances, more so the youth who look up to them for guidance and inspiration,” said Oguna.  He was speaking during a press briefing on the government's preparedness ahead of the elections. Police spokesperson Bruno Shioso said they had embraced a multi-agency approach to ensure the elections are conducted in an atmosphere devoid of hate speech, fake news and violence.       By Daniel Chege | 15 minutes ago By Erick Abuga | 3 hours ago By Peter Muiruri | 5 hours ago By Ishaq Jumbe | 13 hours ago
