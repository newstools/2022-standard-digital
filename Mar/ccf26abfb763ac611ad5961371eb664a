Bonny Khalwale and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala during Cleo Malala Super Cup tournament at Mumias Sports complex. [Mumo Munuve, Standard ]  Deputy President William Ruto is speedily rolling out his new strategy to avert a possible falling out in party nominations expected in three weeks.  Yesterday, Ruto oversaw a deal between former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale and the current senator Cleophas Malala.  In the power-sharing agreement, Khalwale will now campaign for Malala to succeed Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who has served his two terms.  The Kenya Kwanza team will also back Khalwale in an effort to recapture the seat he lost to Malala. The development comes a day after the DP struck a similar deal in Narok County, where the former Chief Administrative Secretary Stephen Ntutu will carry UDA's flag in the governor's race while Governor Samuel Tunai will run for the Senate seat.    Yesterday, Ruto took his campaigns to Athi River and urged locals to vote in youthful leaders with an impressive development record.  Ruto also outlined the Jubilee government's achievements.  “We did the job but now the term has ended and we have another chance to form the government,” he said.  Rooting for his bottom-up economic model, the DP said his government would put the people first.  “We will put aside Sh100 billion to create jobs for over four million youth,” said Ruto.  Ruto attacked the government's clampdown on unregistered scrap metal dealers.  “If there are criminals let the police deal with them but let legal businesses from boda boda to scrap metal dealers do business like any other without interference,” said Ruto.
