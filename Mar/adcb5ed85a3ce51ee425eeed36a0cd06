Governor Tunai, 53, has served as Narok County chief for the last two terms, meaning he will not be eligible to vie for a third term.  Though he did not announce his next political step, sources indicate that Tunai is eyeing Narok Senatorial seat currently held by Senator Ladema Olekina. Tunai, who holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Administration and International Relations from the University of Nairobi, ventured into politics in 2013.  That year, he successfully won the governor’s seat on the now-defunct United Republican Party (URP) ticket, and later retained the same post in 2017, this time around, on a Jubilee Party ticket.  On Friday, March 25, Tunai officially moved to UDA as he strategises ahead of the August 9 polls.  Tunai was welcomed to UDA by Deputy President William Ruto.  “Governor Samuel Tunai brings valuable leadership experience that will help steer Narok County and the nation to greater heights,” said Ruto.
