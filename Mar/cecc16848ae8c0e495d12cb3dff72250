Jeremiah John Mwaniki Nyagah when he announced that he will vie for the presidency, at a Kutus hotel yesterday. [Jane Mugambi, Standard]  The eldest son of former Cooperatives Minister Joe Nyagah has launched his presidential bid as an independent candidate.  Jeremiah John Mwaniki Nyagah, 44, said that after burying his father in 2020, he was yet to see a strong leader emerge from Mt Kenya to accomplish the dreams his father had.  Mr Nyagah said his main agenda will be to fight corruption. He added that despite never having worked in government, he was sure that Kenyans were tired of corrupt politicians and yearned for an untainted leader.  "I have worked hard for over 20 years paying my taxes, but I have gotten tired and feel I have to put a stop to all the madness of corruption. Kenyans want leaders who will protect their resources and not loot. This is my main aim and that was also my father's to protect public resources."  Mr Nyagah said he would form a third force "that represents a large number of Kenyans who are undecided", adding that the coalition "will be realised during the run-off in the presidential race."
