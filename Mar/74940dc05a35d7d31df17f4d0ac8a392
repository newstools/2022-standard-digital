[Daniel Chege, Standard]  The Nakuru County government can only provide water to about 66 per cent of the population in both urban and semi-urban areas.  The target for the Nakuru Water and Sanitation Services Company Limited (Nawassco) is 320 square kilometres while its supply only serves 250 square kilometres.  Governor Lee Kinyanjui in a past interview said Nawassco has a capacity of producing 45,000 cubic metres of water daily against a demand of 70,000 cubic metres, leading to rationing.  Nawassco Managing Director Mr James Ng’ang’a said the company serves a population of more than one million during the day and approximately 530,000 people during the night. Nawassco sources its water from 25 boreholes; one in Kiundo, eight in Kabatini, three in Nairobi Road, five in Baharini, and eight in Olbanita within the county.  The Naivasha Water and Sanitation Company Limited (Naivawasco) gets its raw water from 13 boreholes, located in six production sites. It serves a population of about 170, 000 out of the 198,444 people, according to the 2019 census. The Itare Dam project meant to serve about 800,000 residents of Nakuru County by yielding 100,000 cubic metres per day stalled. The only options are boreholes and springs.  Water shortage in Nakuru is worse in parts of Gilgil, Molo, Njoro, Kuresoi North, Rongai, Naivasha and Kiamunyi. To increase supply, the county government embarked on an underground water harvesting programme. It involved drilling and rehabilitating boreholes to boost supply.  It set aside Sh1.1 billion for water projects last year. The cost of drilling a borehole in Nakuru ranges between Sh700,000 to Sh3 million.  A survey by the Catholic Diocese of Nakuru on 32 boreholes showed the water had high fluoride concentrations which have health implications on humans and animal. “About 87 boreholes have fluoride levels higher than the limit recommended by the World Health Organisation for safe drinking water,” the report says.  A borehole drilled on December 14, 2019, in Solai within Rongai, emitted flammable gas. Thereafter, the government cautioned residents of Bahati, Subukia and Rongai to avoid sinking boreholes.  Mr James Bowen, a farmer in Rongai, has drilled a 275m borehole in his home. It cost him more than Sh2 million.  However, water from the borehole is between 65 to 67 degrees Celsius and he has to cool it before using. “I spend more on cooling it but then I realized, it is a bit salty,” he told The Standard.  One of the county projects include a Sh100 million water project in Kuresoi North aimed at achieving 60 per cent coverage and reducing shortage. Meanwhile, Sh27 million Mau Summit water project in Kamara Ward in Kuresoi North Sub County serving 7,000 households.
