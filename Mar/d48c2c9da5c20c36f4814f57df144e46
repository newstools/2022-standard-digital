Dorcas Nthenya Joseph before Senior Principal Magistrate Robinson Ondiek, March 24, 2022. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  A woman was on Thursday freed on a bond of Sh50,000 or a cash bail of Sh30,000 after denying a charge of forging a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).  Dorcas Nthenya Joseph, who appeared before Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Robinson Ondiek, is accused of forging the document on or about February 2 with the intent to defraud.  Nthenya reportedly claimed the certificate was from Kenya National Examination Council.  She was held at Capital Hill Police Station before being presented before the court. Her case will be mentioned on April 7.  Meanwhile, a city lawyer was charged before the same court with forging a will.  The court heard that Mr Simon Kamere forged the will on or before May 29, 2014, at Ukulima Co-operative House along Haille Sellasie Avenue in Nairobi.  The charge sheet said the lawyer, with another person not in court, and with intent to snatch the estate of the late Pius Kimani Mwaura, forged the document that was dated May 29, 2014, and claimed it was a genuine document signed by the deceased.  Kamere faced a second count when he was charged that on March 17, 2020, at the same building, knowingly and fraudulently, handed a forged will to one Monica Njoki Kimani.  Ms Njoki, according to the charge sheet, is the daughter of the late Mwaura.  The lawyer was released on a bond of Sh1 million or alternatively cash bail of Sh500, 000.  His case will also be mentioned on April 7.    By Stephanie Wangari and Wilberforce Okwiri | 20 hours ago By James Wanzala | 1 day ago By David Njaaga | 1 day ago By Fred Kagonye | 1 day ago
