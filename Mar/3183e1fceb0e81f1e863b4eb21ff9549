Police in Machakos are investigating the circumstances under which a woman was killed at night.  Faith Mueni, 35, and her husband Harrison Mutisya, went to sleep after taking their meals on Friday last week at their home in Kikumbo village, Kalama sub-county.  The next day, however, Mueni was found dead in bed with her husband missing. Her body was found in a pool of blood and had deep panga cuts on her head.  Richard Muiva and Florence Muiva, the deceased's parents-in-law reported the matter to the Assistant Chief and later to Konza Police Station. Machakos sub-county DCIO Simon Waithaka said his officers are still pursuing Mr Mutisya to shed light on the woman's death.  He added officers discovered a panga in a toilet within the homestead.  According to Mr Muiva, his son did not have any issues with his wife and the couple seemed happy before the horrible incident.     By Anne Atieno | 2 days ago By Stephanie Wangari | 3 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 3 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 5 days ago
