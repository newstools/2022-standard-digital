Police in Ruiru, Kiambu County discovered bodies of two men in an abandoned car on Wednesday, March 9, 2022. [File, Standard]  Police in Ruiru, Kiambu County on Wednesday, March 9 discovered bodies of two middle-aged men left in a Toyota Probox that had eight bullet holes.  Also found in the car at 2:15am, were documents of a Ruiru-based cosmetics firm.  The security manager of Tatu City, Stephen Muiruri, told police that one of the estate’s security guards, Simon Kinyanjui, alerted him that a white Toyota Probox without registration plates had been abandoned on the Ruiru Kiambu Road, a few metres past Destiny Hotel.  Police from Ruiru Sub-County, consequently, visited the scene, where they found bodies of the two men in the abandoned car. “The vehicle had eight bullet holes in the left and right sides,” a police report filed at the Membley Police Station under the OB Number 02/09/03/2022 said.  The men, police said, succumbed to gunshot injuries.  “In the boot [of the car], registration plates bearing the number KCX 385D were found,” authorities said.  “Assorted documents belonging to Sassy Cosmetics Company Limited were also retrieved.”  Police say preliminary investigations indicate the two men were killed elsewhere and their bodies dumped in Ruiru.  Bodies of the two men were taken to City Mortuary in Nairobi on Wednesday dawn.  “They are awaiting identification and postmortem,” police said, adding that the Toyota Probox, in which the bodies were discovered, was towed to Ruiru Police Station.
