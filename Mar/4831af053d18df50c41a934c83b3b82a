Smoke billows as passers-by watch after a fuel tanker exploded in a road accident along the Eldoret-Malaba Highway. [Omero Juliet, Standard]  Several people are feared dead after a fuel tanker exploded this evening at Mukhonje market along the Kipkaren-Webuye road, Kakamega.  Matete Sub-County Police boss told The Standard that they are working round-the-clock to contain the fire.  "We have firefighters at the scene but the fire is huge. We suspect that it could have started when the tanker headed to Malaba border from Nairobi collided with another lorry," he said.  Police said that they could not immediately establish whether there were casualties or injuries from the accident.    "We are afraid that the fire could spread to nearby shops and homes,” Northern Corridor Transit Patrol Unit Police Commander Joshua Nyasimi said.  2/2 The fire is being put off by help of a fire engine. Police have cordoned the scene and no injuries to the public. Only one nearby kiosk caught fire. More details to follow once the fire has been contained and scene managed. — National Police Service-Kenya (@NPSOfficial_KE) March 12, 2022 Traffic built up along the road with several motorists opting to use alternative routes.
