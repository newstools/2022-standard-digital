[Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Leaders who were elected on Jubilee Party tickets and who have paid nomination fees to other parties but haven't resigned from the ruling party risk losing their positions.  Speaking when he met with aspirants in Subukia, Nakuru County yesterday, Jubilee Secretary General Jeremiah Kioni said the party will kick out disloyal members.  “I will be writing to the county assemblies directing them to remain faithful to the law. The receipts of them having paid nomination fees to another party is evidence enough for resignation,” said Mr Kioni.  The Ndaragwa MP added: “The law is clear that if you change your political party you automatically lose your seat. The defectors should be warned that any further payment they will draw is illegal and shall be recovered later.”   He was accompanied by Kieni MP Kanini Kega who was recently appointed Jubilee Party Director of Elections. Mr Kega called on speakers of Parliament and county assemblies to stick to the law.  “If the defectors won’t communicate to the party, we shall communicate to the speakers of their respective houses to declare their seats vacant. Speakers should not allow members to illegally sit in Houses,” he said.  By Kamau Muthoni | 8 hours ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 8 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 8 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 8 hours ago
