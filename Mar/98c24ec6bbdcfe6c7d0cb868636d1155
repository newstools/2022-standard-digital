Tharaka Nithi Senator Prof Kithure Kindiki and Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika during Media briefing ahead of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) preparation. [Jonah Onyango, Standard]  Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki has said he did not mean to say Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua would attend today’s UDA National Delegates Convention.  In a statement, Kindiki said it was a slip of tongue and that he meant to say Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula.    In an apology to both Wetangula and Karua, and their respective political parties for the mix-up Kindiki said, “In an inadvertent, honest slip of the tongue, I referred to “Ford Kenya Leader Martha Karua” expected to attend the UDA NDC tomorrow. I meant Ford Kenya Moses Wetangula.” Kindiki in a press conference on Monday said Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua would be among other political leaders who would attend the NDC.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the history of our UDA party and the 2022 electoral cycle. It is the day one of the largest political parties we have in the country is going to unveil its presidential candidate,” Kindiki said adding, “We expect over 5,000 delegates and other political parties to troop in”.  Kindiki had said Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford-Kenya’s Moses Wetangula and Martha Karua among others would attend.
