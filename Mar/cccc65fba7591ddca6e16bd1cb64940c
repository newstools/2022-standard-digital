[Jenipher Wachie, Standard]  The Chama Ya Mapatano Kenya has endorsed Ms Damaris Too as its presidential candidate of the August 9 polls.  Mrs Too is also the party leader. She will now battle it out with Deputy President William Ruto and ODM's Raila Odinga, among others. She is officially the second woman to be endorsed to vie for the presidency after businesswoman Ms Grita Muthoni.  In her acceptance speech yesterday at Ufungamano Hall, Nairobi, Mrs Too said she is up to the task. "I asked myself who is the best candidate that will cater for my needs and looking around I couldn’t spot one, so I thought why shouldn’t I be the change that I need."  She said if elected, she will focus on youth, women and persons living with disability. Further, Mrs Too said she will fight for respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights.
