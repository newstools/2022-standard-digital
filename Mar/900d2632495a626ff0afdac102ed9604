The High Court in Nakuru has upheld a Magistrate's Court order that cancelled bond granted to a man accused of defiling and committing an indecent act with a 15-year-old girl.  The trial court was forced to cancel Aaron Kiplagat’s bond after it was informed that he had been interfering with the witness. Kiplagat had filed an application in November last year seeking a review of the ruling while also urging the High Court to reinstate his bond terms.  He had been released on a Sh200,000 bond after pleading not guilty. Kiplagat argued that there was no evidence of harassment.  But Justice Hillary Chemitei noted that compelling reasons had been raised warranting the termination of the bond.  By Julius Chepkwony | 3 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 hours ago By Brian Kipkorir | 3 hours ago
