[Kamau Muthoni, Standard]  Marjan Hussein Marjan has this afternoon taken the oath of office as the new IEBC Chief Executive Officer.  Marjan was sworn in at the Supreme Court building on Wednesday, in an event presided over by Chief Justice Martha Koome.  IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati expressed confidence in Marjan’s leadership, even as the country prepares for a General Election.  “It’s a tough position but we believe in you,” Chebukati noted. Marjan, who has been in an acting capacity since 2018, takes over from Ezra Chiloba, who is now the Director-General of the Communications Authority of Kenya.  The CEO vacancy was advertised in December 2021, attracting 511 applicants.  Only five candidates were shortlisted and interviews conducted on March 8, 2022.  Marjan will head the IEBC Secretariat that manages the day-to-day running of the Commission.  Voter Registry  IEBC says it has procured all election material and will start an audit of the voter registry in coming days, to be conducted by audit firm, KPMG.  “We have already identified KPMG to work with. They won the tender, beating four other bidders,” Chair Wafula Chebukati said.  He added that the electoral commission is committed to delivering a free, fair, and credible election in the August polls.
