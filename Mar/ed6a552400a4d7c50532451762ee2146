Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha. [File, Standard]  Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has revealed that the 2021 KCPE results will be released on Monday, March 28, or Tuesday, March 29.  Magoha made the revelation on Wednesday, March 23, when he opened KCSE exam container at Kibra, Nairobi.  The minister says the results will be announced after President Uhuru Kenyatta gives him the go-ahead to do so on Monday or Tuesday next week.  “We have completed marking of the exam. We are now finalising the tallying and verification of the results before they can be certified as ready for release,” he said. There were reports that the exam results would be out this week.  According to data from the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC), 1,225,507 candidates enrolled for the 2021 KCPE exam.  Education CS Magoha addressed concerns that the country is not fully prepared to roll out junior secondary.  The minister said the government will train more teachers to adequately serve Grade Seven and Grade Eight learners.  He also revealed that at least 4,000 junior secondary classrooms have been constructed, and another 1,500 are due for completion.  “Within ten days [from today], we hope to complete 6,497 classrooms. That means we’d have done more than 50 per cent of the classrooms as advised by President Kenyatta,” he said.  According to Magoha, Grade Six transition will take place in May, and that the pupils will write the exam in December, “which has already been set”.  The pioneer Grade Six learners under the 2-6-3-3-3 education system, will be seeking to top up 40 per cent of the marks during the December exam.
