Bishop Margret Wanjiru, Nairobi County gubernatorial aspirant at a past rally in the city. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]  Bishop Margaret Wanjiru has discredited claims that she has quit the race for Nairobi governor and opted for the Senate seat.  On Friday, an image of Sh125,000 receipt, said to be Mrs Wanjiru’s payment for her nomination as Nairobi Senator before UDA primaries next month, surfaced on social media.   “There is nothing like that. That photo has been stamped fake. I’m firmly in the race for governor... That is why a lot of people try to tarnish my name,” she said yesterday.  She accused her competitors of using opinion polls to mislead the electorate. Earlier this week, a poll by Trends and Insights Africa placed Nairobi Senator Mr Johnson Sakaja as leading in the race for the city governor with 23 per cent rating. He was closely followed by Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi (14 per cent), then incumbent Ms Anne Kananu and Azimio la Umoja’s Richard Ngatia at seven per cent and six per cent respectively.  A brewing standoff between Mr Sakaja and Mrs Wanjiru has also threatened to split Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s votes in Nairobi.  The plan by Deputy President William Ruto-led UDA is to field Mr Sakaja and Mrs Wanjiru to face off with Azimio camp.
