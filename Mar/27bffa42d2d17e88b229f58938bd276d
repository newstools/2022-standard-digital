ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna (centre), Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito (left) and Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi addressing media on the resolutions arrived at after holding National Executive Council ahead of National Governing Council Meeting at the Chungwa house last month. [Jenipher Wachie, Standard]  Elders have condemned the alleged mistreatment of MP Justus Kizito during an Azimio la Umoja rally on Sunday.  The lawmaker was heckled and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed snatched the microphone from him in the presence of ODM leader Raila Odinga when he took to the podium at Shinyalu trading centre.   The MP later sought the audience of elders who are now demanding an apology from the Orange party.  “Kizito is still Shinyalu MP and deserves respect. We suspect plans to heckle Kizito were well choreographed by some top ODM leaders. This could be part of an elaborate scheme to impose former MP Lisamula Anami on the people of Shinyalu, and it will not work,” said spokesman Lawrence Itolondo.     By Philip Muasya | 25 minutes ago By Harold Odhiambo and James Omoro | 25 minutes ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 25 minutes ago By Grace Nganga | 25 minutes ago
