[Collins Kweyu, Standard]  The fate of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is expected to be sealed today when the Supreme Court gives the final judgement.  The campaign for and against the initiative has created a lot of heat and division before. With the ongoing campaigns for the August General Election, the verdict is expected to generate even more debate. However, the political class should desist from using the verdict as a campaign tool to divide Kenyans. Above all, all Kenyans should unite for peace irrespective of the BBI verdict ahead of the polls.
