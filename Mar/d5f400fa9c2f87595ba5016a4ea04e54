Azimio Presidential hopeful Raila Odinga in a past Nyamira town rally [File, Standard]  The General Election is five months away and aspirants are leaving nothing to chance in their quest to win seats. But while at it, many have resorted to claims that could fuel tensions.  We call on politicians to sell their agenda without engaging in acts that only serve to contaminate the campaign season.  This is the time leaders have an obligation to weigh their words carefully and only make statements that add value to our democracy without compromising peace and security.  Countries whose leaders compete on the basis of ideas have thriving economies and a bright political future. Let campaigns ahead of the August 9 election be issue-based.
