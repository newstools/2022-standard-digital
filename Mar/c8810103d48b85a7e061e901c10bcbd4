Palatial homes under construction at Elgon View estate in Eldoret. [Kevin Tunoi, Standard]  A court in Eldoret heard that armed robbers broke into a couple’s home in Elgon View and demanded Sh500,000 two years ago.  While testifying before Principal Magistrate Naomi Wairimu, Barnaba Kosgei said the axe-wielding robbers threatened him and his wife, Yulita Mitei.  Mr Kosgei was testifying in a robbery with violence case against David Ayuya and his wife Amina Melisa. Other suspects are still at large.  Kosgei said the robbers took their phones and transferred at least Sh51,000 from their M-Pesa accounts. Patrick Chelimo, an M-Pesa agent, testified that Ayuya had later withdrawn money from his shop. The case will continue on June 13.   By Julius Chepkwony | 3 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 3 hours ago
