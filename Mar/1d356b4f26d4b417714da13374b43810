Narc-Kenya party leader Martha Karua [The Standard]  NARC-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua is expected to address the press later today (Wednesday, March 23).  It is expected the former Gichugu Member of Parliament will make a major announcement in regard to her standing in the upcoming elections.  A poster sent out by NARC-Kenya on social media suggested Karua will take a stab at the presidency in the August 9 polls.  “A time to finally steer the nation is finally here and change is at sight,” NARC-Kenya said in a tweet on its official page. The press conference will allow Karua shed more light in regard to the seat she is eyeing in the general election.  The address will be held at 11am at the NARC-Kenya Party Headquarters on Woodlands Road, Off Lenana Road in Hurlingham, Nairobi.  Karua’s press conference comes a day after she said the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) was dead following the decision by co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper Party and Gideon Moi of KANU Party to work with the Azimio la Umoja coalition.  Both Gideon and Kalonzo have thrown their weight behind the presidential candidature of ODM leader Raila Odinga.
