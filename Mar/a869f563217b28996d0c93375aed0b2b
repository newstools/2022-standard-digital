River Yala, Gem, Siaya County. [Collins Oduor, Standard]  A family in Ngurumo village, Kirimukuyu, Mathira West, Nyeri County is mourning after their missing son John Kiruki, 28, who went missing on September 3, 2021, was found dead at Yala Sub-County Hospital Mortuary in Siaya County.  Three trips of relatives had traveled from Nairobi and the village which is 7km from Karatina town and were Thursday on the way home with the body of the deceased described by neighbours as an ambitious youth and father of a one-year-old toddler.    The family said John Kiruki disappeared while he was working in Nairobi as a hawker and boda boda operator. He used to hawk household plastic and kitchenware in the Eastlands where he had retreated after completing secondary school.
