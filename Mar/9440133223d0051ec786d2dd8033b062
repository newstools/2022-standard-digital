Police in Kakamega have arrested a man masquerading as a surgeon in a private hospital in Khwisero sub-county.  Khwisero sub-county police commander Samuel Kogo said the suspect had been offered a job at a local dispensary.  According to Kogo, the owner of the facility became suspicious after he discovered the man had challenges handling patients.  “The owner of the dispensary, being a doctor sensed something was amiss during the job interview and decided to give him a simple test but after some time, the proprietor sensed something was amiss after seeing the way the suspect was interacting with patients," said Kogo.  "He summoned the 'doctor' on duty and tasked him to keep watch on the suspect and find out whether he was a qualified doctor as he claimed," said the officer. He said the suspect attempted to escape after the doctor on duty approached him and demanded to know whether he understood common medical jargon and his knowledge about certain illnesses and how to handle patients.  "That prompted the 'fake' doctor to start running away but the health facility's owner raised the alarm and residents managed to waylay and arrest the suspect before he could escape," said the police.  For a moment a charged mob rained blows on the suspect before police officers came to his rescue according to Kogo.  “He was rescued by police and he is nursing serious injuries on his head,” said Kogo.  Police recovered a bag that contained different types of medicines that were not branded by the suspect.  "We could not immediately establish the type of medicines he was carrying."  The suspect confessed that he was not versed in treating people during grilling at Khwisero police station where he is currently being held.  Kogo said the suspect will be arraigned in court immediately the officers after investigations into the matter.
