Acting Director-General for Health Dr. Patrick Amoth. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  On March 5, the Ministry of Health issued an alert over yellow fever following the death of three people in Isiolo County. Acting Director General in the ministry, Dr Patrick Amoth, said at the time that plans were on to conduct yellow fever vaccination in various counties.  However, the matter seems to have died down. It is not clear if this vaccination has started and most Kenyans do not know where to go for it. Perhaps the ministry should launch a mass vaccination campaign before the fever spirals out of control.  Kenyans should also be educated on prevention measures such as sleeping under treated mosquito nets instead of using the nets for fishing. Let us take precaution early enough as a country to avert another health crisis.    By Editorial | 55 minutes ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Godfrey Ombogo | 2 days ago
