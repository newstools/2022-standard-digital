They were arrested in connection to an assault of a lady motorist on Forest Road [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  Sixteen boda boda operators have been arraigned over an assault of a woman motorist during an incident captured in a viral video.  The investigating officer, Inspector Lyvonne Mwanzia, was yesterday granted 20 days to complete investigations.  Mwanzia said detectives were pursuing other suspects in the Friday incident, which occured on Wangari Maathai Road in Nairobi.  “This case is of public interest and I, among other things, need to record a statement from the victim, suspects and other witnesses,” she told Senior Principal Magistrate Gilbert Shikwe. Mwanzia told the court that police were yet to issue a P3 form to the motorist as she was still traumatised and had not reported back to work at the World Food Programme.    Investigators are also seeking a key suspects’ mobile phone communication data and CCTV footage.  The prosecution agreed with the investigating officer, saying the suspects had no fixed abode and were likely to run away from justice.  The suspects are James Muema, Samuel Muswahili, Charles Were, Japheth Obano, Hassan Forah, Lincoln Kinyanjui, Joseph Mbugu and Lenson Njururi.   Others are Harrison Irungu, Benjamin Githimii, Igantius Mufwolobo, Martin Maina, Shadrack Luyeku, Shadrack Nyamai, Cliff Oyaro and Joseph Mukambi.     By Kamau Muthoni | 8 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 8 hours ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 8 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 8 hours ago
