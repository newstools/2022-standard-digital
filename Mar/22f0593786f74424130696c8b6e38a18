Facing arrest, Embu Governor Martin Wambora. [File, Standard]  The Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nyeri has issued a warrant of arrest against Embu Governor Martin Wambora and several officials in his government for failing to appear before it for contempt sentencing.  Justice Njagi Marete issued the warrants against Wambora, County Secretary County Jason Nyaga, Finance and Economic Planning Executive John Njagi and his Chief Officer Ruth Ndirangu.  A ruling issued last Thursday found them in contempt of court for failing to remit the Kenya County Government Workers' Union statutory fees despite a court order issued on December 1, 2020.  The judge instructed the OCS Nyeri Police station to arrest the governor and officials and bring them to court for sentencing. Governor Wambora is the chairman of the Council of Governors.
