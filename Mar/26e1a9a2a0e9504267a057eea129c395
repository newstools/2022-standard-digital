Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi has rubbished claims that he has dropped his bid for Nairobi governor.   A poster widely circulated on social media suggested that Mr Wanyonyi will deputise his rival Richard Ngatia.  But speaking yesterday when he met supporters, the legislator said he his firmly in the race.  Mr Wanyonyi termed the reports on social media as fake. He reduced it to smear campaigns meant to mislead voters.  “At no point have I talked to any of my opponents about quitting the race neither have I at any point talked to anyone about becoming a deputy,” he said.   Mr Wanyonyi said those behind the fake report are political rivals out to spread “cheap lies”.  He continued: “When my Westlands people needed me for 10 years, I stayed. Similarly, when my people of Nairobi need me, as they will, I will be there for them.”  Mr Wanyonyi said under his leadership, hawkers will operate from designated areas that are conducive for business.   “No county askari will be allowed to harass hawkers and in case this is reported to me, I will act accordingly,” he added.
