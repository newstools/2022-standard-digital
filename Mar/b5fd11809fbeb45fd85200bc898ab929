Mbita Police Station in Homa Bay County [James Omoro, Stanard]  A man and his wife have been arrested for the death of their 26-year-old daughter in Sigulu, Ruri East Location, Mbita.  Their daughter's throat was slit. Mbita DCI commander Phillip Sang yesterday said the parents insist they found her dead.  But Mr Sang says the scene had been tampered with before the police were called.  Furthermore, the steel door did not show signs of forced entry. Reports show the couple heard a commotion where the girl was sleeping but upon checking, found her dead. The parents are being held at Mbita police station.     By Olivia Odhiambo | 2 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 2 hours ago By Stanley Ongwae | 1 day ago By Harold Otieno Odhiambo | 1 day ago
