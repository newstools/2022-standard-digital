Edwin Sifuna with CEC Janet Ouko during Azimio la Umoja's tour of Dagoretti, Westlands and Kangemi. March 17, 2022. [David Njaaga, Standard]  The Azimio la Umoja brigade yesterday hit at Deputy President Dr William Ruto, claiming he is a lightweight politician, who cannot emerge victorious in a face-off with ODM leader Mr Raila Odinga.  Responding to Dr Ruto’s remarks on Saturday, which accused Mr Odinga of hiding behind President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM Secretary General Mr Edwin Sifuna, told Dr Ruto that he is lucky that the president is in the picture.  “We want to tell Dr Ruto that he is lucky the president is standing between him and Mr Odinga because if you meet with him (Mr Odinga) head-on, you will be in a lot of trouble,” said Mr Sifuna.  In the company of other Azimio allied politicians, Mr James Orengo, Mr Maina Kamanda, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino and Mr Peter Kenneth, Mr Sifuna stated that the Dr Ruto camp has no chance of winning the election since the Azimio team is ready to scoop 80 per cent of the votes. The team also centred their campaign around Mr Raila’s candidature wooing the residents of Mathare, Dandora and Pangani. They urged residents to vote for Mr Raila, who has promised to give monthly allowances to families with no source of income and support single mothers once elected as president.   “Mr Raila has a plan for this country and that is why we are here to ask you to vote for him on August 9, 2022,” said Sifuna. Mr Raila has also promised to offer better services for residents and financing of these projects will come from money currently being lost through corruption.   Yesterday’s campaign marked the fifth consecutive day for Azimio political crusades in Nairobi with similar activities expected today in Embakasi central, Kasarani and Roysambu.
