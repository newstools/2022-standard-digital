Rift Valley Regional Commissioner Mohamed Maalim addresses the press in Nakuru on February 24, 2022.[Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  The government has revived the National Police Reservists (NPRs) in an effort to tame banditry in Baringo North and South constituencies.   Rift Valley Regional Commissioner Mohamed Maalim yesterday commissioned 80 NPRs in Mochongoi, one of the troubled spots.  He said the civilian gun holders will be trained by GSU officers to help tackle the growing insecurity in the region.  "Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i promised to give police reservists and today we have recruited 80 in Baringo South and North. We need to see their work," said Mr Maalim. There was a heavy presence of security personnel as the administrator, local leaders and  senior government officials toured the troubled spots.  The residents heaved a sigh of relief following the deployment of the reservists. They believe the reservists know the area well and will help repulse attackers.    In May 2019, the state banned reservists in the area on claims that some of them had taken sides in the clashes.  Yesterday, Mr Maalim said explained that  NPR was disbanded because some of them used their firearms illegally.  He warned those recruited to do the work expected of them.   Maalim said he was disturbed to see women and children scamper for safety during attacks.  "We know your lives have changed but March 8, 2022 marks a day to bring sanity in this region," said Maalim who spoke at Mochongoi Assistant County Commissioner's ground.  He said as government they continue to follow up on what locals had requested during a meeting with leaders from West Pokot, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet in February.  Baringo Senator Gideon Moi in January promised to engage the government to have police reservists deployed to the region.     By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 3 hours ago By Brian Kipkorir | 3 hours ago
