Mercy Nkirote allegedly tortured her three-year-old stepdaughter. [Kelvin Karani, Standard]  A woman has been detained by Shanzu Law Courts for allegedly torturing her three-year-old stepdaughter under her care.  State Prosecutor Peris Bosibori yesterday applied to have Mercy Nkirote detained for one day to allow police make available a medical report and amend the charge sheet.  The child had visible marks on the face and chest and her right hand was hurt.  The prosecutor applied to have the girl rescued and put into the safe custody of the Tononoka Children's Court. “Given the relationship of the minor and the suspect is stepdaughter and stepmother, we feel it is not safe to have her stay with her. We seek to have the child rescued,” said Bosibori.  Nkirote did not oppose her detention, pending plea taking set for today.  “The suspect to be detained until tomorrow to allow amendment of charge sheet,” said Principal Magistrate Yusuf Shikanda.  Nkirote has been staying with the girl for three months together with her other two-year-old daughter in Bamburi Mwisho.  The girl was reportedly abandoned by her biological mother who left her with her father.  The girl's father said he would not like his daughter to be sent to a children’s home and will be seeking to have her remain under his or her sister’s custody.  The minor’s aunt noticed the torture marks and upon inquiring, she opened up that she had been beaten by her stepmother.   By Kipkoech Tanui | 25 minutes ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 3 hours ago By Peter Muiruri | 4 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 12 hours ago
