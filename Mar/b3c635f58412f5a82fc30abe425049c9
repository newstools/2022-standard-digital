Moses Khaoya. [File, Standard]  Businessman Moses Khaoya has joined the race for Trans Nzoia governor.  He will be seeking an ODM ticket. His entrance brings to two the number of hopefuls eyeing the party nomination.  Mr Khaoya contested for the seat in 2017 as an independent and emerged fourth. He said he has marshalled resources and is ready to square it out with other aspirants.  “Trans Nzoia requires a development conscious leader who understands residents’ needs,” Mr Khaoya told The Standard in Bungoma town. He said he has registered as an ODM life member after his supporters urged him to do so. Mr Khaoya regretted that Trans Nzoia lags in development and leaders who have held leadership positions have not done much to improve the situation.  “It is time to correct the mess,” he added.  Others eyeing to succeed Governor Patrick Khaemba who is serving his second and final term are Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, former Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya and Mr Philemon Samoe.  Also in the race is Ms Dorcas Njenga who is eyeing the ODM ticket.  Among the issues shaping the campaigns are underdevelopment, unemployment, lack of industries and value addition for local produce and poor agriculture performance, especially maize farming.  The battle between Azimio la Umoja and Kenya Kwanza, the aspirants’ performance record and community voting blocs also play a crucial role in the vote hunt.  Deputy President William Ruto’s former aide Maurice Bisau quit the governorship race in favour of Natembeya. He will vie for the Kiminini parliamentary seat on a DAP-K ticket.  The county is dominated by the Luhya community as well as Kalenjin.  By Robert Amalemba | 18 hours ago By John Shilitsa | 1 day ago By Robert Amalemba | 2 days ago By Biketi Kikechi | 3 days ago
