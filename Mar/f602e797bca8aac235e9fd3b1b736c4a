Five storey building leans on another one at Kinoo in Kiambu County on March 6, 2022. [Denish Ochieng, Standard]  The county government has rolled out a campaign to encourage the public to adhere to construction guidelines and relevant approvals needed in development of their property.  County Chief Officer at the Department of Lands, Housing and Physical Planning Mr Edmund Njihia said the campaign follows multiple cases of collapsed buildings, some while still under construction.  Mr Njihia said the sensitisation plan dubbed 'Land clinics' was necessary to ensure compliance with laid down regulations on matters of land and development.  Mr Njihia said the county had experienced unregulated and uncertified construction of projects over the last few months, with some collapsing or caving in due to poor workmanship or improper supervision, raising the need to create awareness. Mr Njihia spoke while presiding over a sensitisation meeting at the Kiambu Social Hall.    He said the clinic was to safeguard the safety of inhabitants of the new housing units and to ensure the rule of law prevailed. “We caution new land owners to conduct proper search in conjunction with the Department of Lands at the county to reduce instances of past land arrears by the seller being projected to buyers of land,” he said.  He was, however, optimistic that the clinics would help address concerns and educate Kiambu residents on land matters. Mr Njihia urged locals to take advantage of the exercise to learn and also get their queries answered.  During the launch, an assistant Structural Engineer at the County and in charge of reviewing building designs Ian Munene, shared that loopholes and challenges the construction industry experienced.    By Boniface Gikandi | 55 minutes ago By Boniface Gikandi | 10 hours ago By Jane Mugambi | 18 hours ago By Ndung'u Gachane | 1 day ago
