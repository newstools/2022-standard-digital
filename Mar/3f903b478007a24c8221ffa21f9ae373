A view of the Kericho Tea Hotel [Courtesy]  A trade union has appealed against a court ruling cancelling the sale of five acres of land belonging to the Kericho Tea Hotel.  The Kenya Union of Domestic Hotels, Education, Hospitals and Allied Workers (Kudheiha) is seeking details of the judgement delivered by Justice Hellen Wasilwa on January 18 compelling the Kericho Chief Lands Registrar to cancel the title deed on the land.  Businessmen Ravji Chhabhadia, Kanji Chhabdhabia, Chandarakanji Chhabhadia and Shashikant Pindoriya had bought the disputed land at a public auction for Sh110 million.  But the court set aside the purported sale and transfer of the parcel of land. In the notice of appeal lodged at the Employment and Labour Relations Court, Kudheiha lawyer Mr Gilbert Kemboi says the union was dissatisfied with the ruling.  Tea Hotel Ltd and the management are listed as the first and second respondents in the case.  According to Kudhehia, the hotel management had failed to pay Sh5 million for settling salary arrears of its employees and terminal dues for retirees.  Ms Wasilwa ordered Hezron and Getupma Osongo T/A Hegeon Auctioneers to file details of the public auction, including the date, time, bidders and the respective bids.     By Julius Chepkwony | 3 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 3 hours ago By Brian Kipkorir | 3 hours ago
