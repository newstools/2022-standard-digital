Former Jubilee Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju when he met with other elected leaders and political aspirants during a consultative meeting on joint party primaries. [James Omoro, Standard]  Losers in party primaries have an option to run as independent candidates in the August 9 General Election.  The Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu has explained that aspirants floored in the party nominations will have a 10-day window to run as an independent.  Political parties are expected to conduct nominations between April 16 and 22, according to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission timelines.  The electoral commission further provides that independent candidates will have until May 2 to submit their documents. Nderitu told members of the National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that nomination losers will have between April 22 and May 2 to decide if they want to run as independent candidates.  "As the law stands now, within those 10 days someone can be allowed to jump ship and vie as an independent candidate," said Nderitu.  The law, however, bars losers in the primaries from crossing over to a different party.   By Allan Mungai | 39 minutes ago By Patrick Vidija | 4 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 8 hours ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 10 hours ago
