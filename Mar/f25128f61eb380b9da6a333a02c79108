Mama Ngina said President Kenyatta has Kenya's best interest at heart [The Standard]  Former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta has urged Kenyans to follow President Uhuru Kenyatta's direction for a successor ahead of the August 9, polls.   Mama Ngina, who was speaking during her cousin's burial in Gatundu South, Kiambu County on Tuesday, March 22, said President Kenyatta has Kenya's best interest at heart when endorsing ODM leader Raila Odinga.  "He (President Uhuru Kenyatta) cannot lead Kenyans on a path that is not good for them. I tell you, he who sits on a tree stump knows best what the ants eat," said Mama Ngina.  The former First Lady also weighed in on the falling out between President Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, saying the latter had abdicated his duties to focus on presidential campaigns. "..when your deputy starts showing disrespect, would you still stick with him, or will you move on?" she posed.  Additionally, Mama Ngina expressed disappointment at politicians hurling insults at the president. She suggested they were not brought up well.  "We will just let them be if insulting others is how they were taught when growing up," she said.  She also encouraged Kenyans to love one another and enhance national unity.
