Musician Bahati on Friday, March 18, 2022 formally declared interest in Mathare parliamentary seat. [File, Standard]  Musician Bahati, whose real name is Kevin Kioko, has declared interest in the Mathare parliamentary seat.  Bahati says he will seek Jubilee Party’s ticket in April ahead of the August 9 General Election.  “I was born and raised in Mathare. Throughout my nearly-30 years, Mathare has never had a native of the constituency as its representative to the National Assembly. All MPs, who won the Mathare parliamentary seat, have been outsiders, born and raised elsewhere,” Bahati told The Standard.  “It’s high time Mathare was represented by someone who understands its problems, including those historical in nature,” he said. Asked what will happen if he unsuccessfully contests for the party ticket in April, he said: “I don’t try my hand at something that I’d lose in, no.”  The artiste refused to reveal whether he’ll consider the independent candidate route should he fail to secure the Jubilee Party ticket.  Bahati, 29, claims he has been on the campaign trail for the last one year, and that it’s not too late for him to declare interest in the MP seat.  On who he is supporting for president, he said: “Definitely it is Raila Odinga. He is my presidential candidate and I will aggressively campaign for him in Mathare.”  Mathare ‘s current Member of Parliament is Anthony Oluoch, who won the seat on ODM ticket in 2017 polls.  Bahati is a gospel-turned-secular musician, who sprang to fame in May 2013 after releasing the hit song Mama.  Ever since, his career has evolved, officially ditching the gospel sector in July 2020.  His other hit songs include Barua, Adhiambo, Wa Nani, Lala Amka, among others.
