In another attack in Kapyego ward in Marakwet East, two men were also injured and are receiving treatment at Iten County hospital.  Residents, relatives and leaders trooped at Iten Morque where bodies of the two are bding preserved where they demanded answers from the government as to why killings are taking place in Kerio valley without any action.  Elgeyo Marakwet women representative Jane  Kiptoo, Marakwet West legislator William Kipsang, area MCA Christopher Chemosong and other leaders while addressing the media condemned the attack and called for immediate government response.  “Kerio valley has been left for bandits to attack anytime they want despite heavy deployment of security personnel in the region,” Kiptoo said.
