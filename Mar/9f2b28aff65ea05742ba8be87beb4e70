The caretaker broke the bedroom window after receiving complaints of a foul smell coming from the apartment. [File, Standard]  An Italian man found dead on Thursday afternoon at an apartment complex in Mombasa County has been identified as Giuseppe Giarratano.  According to Nyali sub-county Police Commander Daniel Mumasaba, Giarratano, 75, was found lifeless on a couch at his rented two-bedroom apartment in Kisimani Heights.  “He was living alone. He was found dead on his couch, the body swollen and had vomit all over it," said Mumasaba.  Speaking to The Standard, the apartment’s caretaker Dennis Miguna, who led the police into the house after tenants complained of a foul smell coming from Giarratano's window, said the deceased had a plastic bag over his head. The apartment's door, he added, was locked from inside.  "I accessed the apartment through the bedroom window and found the body lying on the couch with a polythene wrapped on his head, and blood oozing from the neck," said Miguna.  Miguna said an unidentified woman came looking for Giarratano two days earlier but left after he failed to answer the door. “His girlfriend (a local) used to stay here, but after they fell out, she moved out,” said Miguna.  Mourning the 75-year-old, a woman whose shop the Italian frequented, said Giarratano led a simple life and was very reserved.  “I don’t know much about his relationships, either with his girlfriend or who came to see him last; he never used to talk much. He minded his own business,” said the shopkeeper.  Police have launched an investigation into the Italian's death.    By Joackim Bwana | 4 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 20 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 20 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 1 day ago
