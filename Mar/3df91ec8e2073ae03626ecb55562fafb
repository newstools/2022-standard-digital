Kenya Kwanza leaders have called for the arrest of ODM leader Raila Odinga over his ‘madoadoa’ remarks during an Azimio la Umoja rally in Wajir, terming it hate speech.  Led by Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki and United Democratic Alliance chairman Johnson Muthama, they called for investigation and prosecution against Raila, saying the law should be applied equally to both Azimio and Kenya Kwanza politicians.  They spoke in reference to Raila’s remarks in Wajir where the former premier used the word ‘madoadoa’ that recently landed Meru Senator Mithika Linturi in trouble. The leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto were addressing rallies in Kilifi and Mombasa counties. They claimed it would amount to double standards if State agencies fail to arrest and question Raila over the remarks.  Prof Kindiki told the Inspector General of Police, Director of Criminal Investigations, National Cohesion and Integration Commission and the Director of Public Prosecution to ensure Raila was charged in court to avoid applying the law selectively.  “Recently, our colleague Linturi was arrested and charged over a slip of the tongue. The day he was alleged to have committed the offence, the senator did not sleep in his house after police officers were sent to arrest him. Linturi and DP Ruto had to issue an apology following the remarks. We, therefore, demand that the DCI and NCIC move swiftly to arrest and charge Raila,” Kindiki said.
