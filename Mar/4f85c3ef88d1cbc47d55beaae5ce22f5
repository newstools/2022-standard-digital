[File, Standard]  A family in Mombasa is asking the government to help them to bring their loved one back from Saudi Arabia so she can get medical attention.  Kibibi Ali left the country last year after she landed the job of a domestic worker in the country in Western Asia.  Her father Ali Bakari, on Tuesday, said his daughter called him asking for help to return home as she was sick but unable to access treatment.  "She called me and said she fell sick and needs urgent medical attention. That is why I am appealing to the government for help," said Bakari. He said his daughter has said that she does not have airfare.  "I am appealing to the government to help me bring my daughter back home. She is suffering from a gynaecological problem after being operated on at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The condition needs urgent medical attention,” said Bakari who spoke to The Standard from his home in Mombasa.  He said Kibibi was recruited by an employment urgency in Mombasa. "After working for her employer for a while, she was transferred to another home. She later became unwell and was operated on," said Bakari.  He added: "Her first employer looked after her well but things changed when she was moved to the second home where she continued working as a maid. The second employer told her to pay house rent and take care of her medical bills. It became difficult for her."  Bakari said Kibibi told her that growth was discovered in her womb.   “The doctors recommended an operation to remove her womb,” said Bakari, adding: "My daughter was later dumped at the office of the recruiting agent in Saudi Arabia. It has been a nightmare for her and the entire family here at home. We are asking the government to help us."
