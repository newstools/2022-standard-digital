The Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral, and Research Hospital has received a grant for throat cancer research.  The Sh446 million is from the National Institute for Health Research, a government agency in the UK that funds health and social care research. The proposal was crafted by Prof George Njoroge of KUTRRH.  During the launch of the chance research centre on Tuesday, Prof Njoroge said oesophageal cancer is the cause of the highest number of deaths.  Experts say cancer is influenced by a combination of genetics, lifestyle, socio-economic and environmental factors. Western and Central Kenya have a high prevalence. Prof Njoroge said researchers aim to reduce mortality by using a joint approach based on the successes of the Manchester team on early detection.    The team hopes to create an environment where patients are treated by clinical and scientific healthcare workers.  A nationwide clinical outcome, a measure that describes how a patient feels, will be undertaken in Kisii, Meru, Nyeri, Nakuru, and Kiambu counties.  During the launch, Prof Lord Graham said the partnership started in 2020.  Prof Graham is the Vice President and Dean of the Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health at the University of Manchester.  Last July, President Uhuru Kenyatta and the team from Kenya were hosted in London where they signed more deals to develop cancer care.  Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has in the past said the cancer burden will continue to increase in the coming days due to the ageing population and lifestyle changes.  This has been worsened by the transition from infectious conditions to Non-Communicable Diseases amid calls to increase the number of oncologists.  Data from the Health Ministry shows the country loses 27,000 people to cancer each year. Some 42,000 new cases are reported every year.
