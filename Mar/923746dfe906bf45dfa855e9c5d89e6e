The suspects were arrested in Murang’a County on Monday, March 7. [Courtesy of DCI]  Police on Monday night, March 7, arrested two women on allegations of bhang-trafficking.  The suspects were arrested in Murang’a County while allegedly transporting six sacks of bhang from Busia to Nairobi.  “In a bid to evade police roadblocks and deliver their supply successfully, the suspects took the long Nakuru-Nyahururu-Nyeri-Murang’a route [instead of the Nakuru-Nairobi highway]. However, detectives acting on a tip-off, intercepted their vehicle at Saba Saba area in Maragua, Murang’a County,” the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said in a statement on Twitter.  “The bhang had neatly been arranged in a grey Toyota Wish that was being driven by the two women,” police said. “Prior to their arrest, the two had engaged transnational and organised crimes detectives in a high-octane highway race, with the woman behind the steering [wheel] exhibiting all signs of a Formula 1 finalist,” said the DCI.  The suspects were transferred to the DCI Headquarters on Kiambu Road in Nairobi, and will be arraigned later Tuesday.  Police did not reveal the weight of the bhang seized, or its street price estimate.
