This is according to new findings released on Friday, by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, ahead of the annual International Day of Happiness.  The findings, therefore, make Kenya the 27th most unhappy Country.  The measurement for subjective well-being relied on three main indicators including; life evaluations, positive emotions, and negative emotions.  Some of the factors that the World Happiness Report considered in the levels of happiness are people's trust in government and institutions, poverty and conflicts.  According to respondents who were interviewed in Kenya, corruption in government was one of the major issues that caused the negative emotions.  Neighbouring Country Uganda ranked two positions higher than Kenya at number 117 while Tanzania was ranked 139.  On the other hand, Rwanda was ranked the most unhappy in the East African Community bloc and fourth-worst globally. It came before Zimbabwe, Lebanon and Afghanistan.
