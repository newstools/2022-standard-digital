Covid -19 AstraZeneca dose. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  That 800,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have expired and another one million doses of Johnson & Johnson could go bad should be a great cause for concern.  The government should have intensified the mass vaccination campaign across the country to avert this kind of waste. Going forward, the Ministry of Health needs to plan properly and project how many doses are likely to be used up within a given period of time. In case of a donation, it costs nothing to request the donor to either hold the consignment until a later date or to exchange it with another vaccine, say for malaria or polio, that the country might need more.  Kenyans also need to know that Covid-19 is still here with us, and the attitude that the pandemic has ended should stop. Everyone should go for the jab!    By Editorial | 13 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
