Wanjiku Waimeri shows injuries on a sheep attacked by a suspected stray leopard at Iwhagi Village in Mathira East [Kibata Kihu, Standard]  A farmer in Mathira, Nyeri County is counting her losses after wild animals attacked and killed four of her sheep on Tuesday night.  The sheep were bitten on the neck and stomach.  Ms Wanjiku Waimeri said her husband heard the animals bleating at around 1am.  “Upon switching on the lights he saw a pack of  wild animals eating their animals,” Ms Waimeri said. Her husband tried to scare away the wild animals but they started walking towards him and he ran for safety.  She said that such attacks have become rampant in the area. “I have incurred a loss of Sh32,000 since one sheep goes for at least Sh8,000,” she said, adding that she will push for compensation from the Kenya Wildlife Service.
