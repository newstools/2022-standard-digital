Raila Odinga making his address at the KICC on Saturday, March 12, 2022. [Standard]  Raila Odinga has been endorsed for President under the Azimio la Umoja Coalition.  The coalition’s national delegates’ conference was held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) on Saturday, March 12, 2022.  At least 26 political parties, including Wiper, Jubilee, ODM and KANU, signed a co-operation pact, that would see the outfits support Raila Odinga’s presidential candidature on August 9.  Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, KANU’s Gideon Moi, NARC’s Charity Ngilu, Maendeleo Chap Chap’s Alfred Mutua, among other party leaders attended the function. President Kenyatta said Kalonzo is a capable politician to take up presidential role, but he sacrificed that quest to support Raila Odinga.  “I am sure that Raila Odinga is capable and willing to lead Kenya. I am praying that God helps him guide the nation. Should he win the presidency, he won’t leave any of the party leaders behind. You’ll see more of Kalonzo, Charity Ngilu, Alfred Mutua, among others, in Raila’s government. May God protect our fifth president,” said President Kenyatta.
