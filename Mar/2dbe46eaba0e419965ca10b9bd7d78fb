State House spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo. [File, Standard]  State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo has refuted allegations that President Uhuru plans to tilt the August 9 presidential election outcome in favour of Raila Odinga.  Kanze, who spoke on Inooro FM on Friday morning, March 4, said the President is keen on ensuring a peaceful election.  “On the forthcoming elections, the President is keen on ensuring that the polls are peaceful, free and fair as can be seen through the ongoing joint preparatory works by various government agencies,” she said.  Her remarks come on the back of allegations by Deputy President William Ruto that President Kenyatta’s administration wants to extend its influence into the next government by supporting Raila Odinga’s presidential bid. In a Thursday speech in the United States, where he is on tour, Ruto said the opposition “is running Kenya’s government, while the President is a refugee in the opposition”.  Opposition party, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), has since answered Ruto, saying his remarks suggest that he would be unwilling to accept poll outcome should he lose to Raila Odinga in the presidential contest.
