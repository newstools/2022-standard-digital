Nelson Akwaka, Mombasa Jubilee Party Secretary-General addresses the press yesterday at Mama Ngina Waterfront. [Robert Menza, Standard]  Jubilee Party leaders in Mombasa yesterday campaigned for Mr Raila Odinga as the Azimio la Umoja presidential flagbearer.  The politicians asked all parties in the coalition to work in harmony.  The group said it has no aspirant for governor after Suleiman Shahbal decamped to ODM last year.  Led by Mombasa branch secretary Mr Nelson Akwaka, senatorial aspirant Mr Hazel Katana and woman rep aspirant Ms Amina Abdalla, they said the party will field candidates for other seats. “We have embarked on campaigns for Raila (Mr Odinga) and for Jubilee aspirants for the 30 wards and other elective positions,” said Mr Akwaka who spoke at Mama Ngina Waterfront.  “We want to win as many seats as possible even as we campaign for Raila (Mr Odinga),” he said.  Abdalla called for harmony in the campaign committee for Mr Odinga to ensure all Azimio la Umoja parties combine efforts for the presidential contender.  Businessman Chrispus Waithaka appealed for smooth transition.    By Grace Ng'ang'a | 1 hour ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 2 hours ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 2 hours ago By Jacob Ng'etich | 2 hours ago
