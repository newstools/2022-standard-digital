Orange Democratic Movement chairman John Mbadi. [James Omoro, Standard]  The withdrawal of ODM Chairman John Mbadi from the Homa Bay governor race has set tongues wagging.  Mbadi surprised his supporters on Monday when he announced that he will no longer contest the seat just a day after businessman Jared Kiasa bowed out of the race in his favour.    Explaining the move, Mbadi said he withdrew his candidature to concentrate on marshalling support for Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate and ODM leader, Raila Odinga. “After wide consultation with my party leader Raila Odinga, I withdrew from Homa Bay governorship race. This is a decision made in the interest of ODM that has been requiring us to have a consensus. I had decided not to defend my Suba South parliamentary seat.  I will not go back for it,” said Mbadi.  He expressed optimism that Odinga will garner the presidency and urged Homa Bay residents to await communication from ODM on how the party’s gubernatorial ticket will be contested, hinting at consensus building to avoid a fallout.  Following his withdrawal, Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, former county-secretary Isaiah Ogwe, businessman Louis Ogingo and KUPPET secretary-general Akelo Misori are set to battle it out for the ticket to succeed Governor Cyprian Awiti.  ODM is set to conduct party primaries across the country between April 1 and April 21, 2022.
