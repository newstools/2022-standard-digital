The government has been urged to relocate power supply poles erected in the middle of a 2.5-kilometre road connecting Erithia and Mwegito estates in Njoro.  The poles have been on the road for nearly twenty years when the residents and students from Egerton University were connected to the national grid.  Residents led by John Kaniaru revealed that the poles ended on the road after the government officially surveyed land in the area and moved boundaries.  “Connection to power supply was made in the 1990s. The land was surveyed later and the boundaries moved,” said Kaniaru, adding that families were forced to demolish their homes because of the new boundaries. Samson Njoroge, a truck driver said they face challenges navigating the route which connects the residential area to farms. “Driving on this road during the rainy season is dangerous as heavy vehicles skid and at times hit the poles," he said.   Kenya Power through Nakuru Business Manager Henry Pwani said the government is acting on the matter.     By Christopher Kipsang | 20 seconds ago By Daniel Chege | 8 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 1 day ago By Antony Gitonga | 1 day ago
