Goats ready for sale. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  A charitable organisation has distributed free goats to vulnerable women, many of them widows.  Each of the 15 beneficiaries of the Financially Fit Africa and The Goat Foundation’s initiative got two goats.  Founder of the Financially Fit Africa Mr Steven Down said that was their fourth initiative in Eastern Africa.   Mr Down was accompanied to Iiuni Primary School in Kalama sub-County by Mr Jacob Mutula, a lawyer. Mr Down said their desire was to empower low- and middle-income households. He said the two organisations had empowered more than 200,000 needy families in the region and targets another 99,700 households by 2025. “A better future for Kenya and Africa lies in empowering needy families to boost their economic status,” said Mr Down.   Mr Mutula, a Machakos Senatorial aspirant, promised more goodies.      By Erastus Mulwa | 3 days ago By John Muia | 10 days ago By John Muia | 11 days ago By Phares Mutembei | 14 days ago
