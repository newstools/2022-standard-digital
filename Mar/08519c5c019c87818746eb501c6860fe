Former Mining and Petroleum CS John Munyes accompanied by Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa during his launch for Turkana governor seat in Lodwar. [Bakari Angela, Standard]  The Council of Elders has raised concerns over claims that Jubilee Party could deny former Petroleum CS John Munyes its ticket in the governor race.  Council chairman Mr Charles Lorogoi said there is a plot to overlook Mr Munyes in favour of Turkana South MP James Lomenen.  “Munyes is a popular candidate in the region who is capable of flying the party ticket. We don’t trust people who hop from one party to another,” Mr Lorogoi said.  Mr Lomenen ditched Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party for Mr Ukur Yatani’s UPIA before decamping to Jubilee Party last week. “Let us not mix oil issues with elections. You cannot use oil issue to negotiate for seats yet you are an unpopular character in the region,” Mr Lorogoi said.
