The management of Guru Nanak Hospital got a reprieve after the High Court dismissed a petition calling for the ouster of top officials on allegations of administrative misconduct.  Justice Anthony Ndung’u, in dismissing a petition by Jasvinder Singh Bilkhu, said the issues raised were internal matters related to the running of the hospital's affairs.  The judge said that Mr Bilkhu had failed to exhaust internal mechanisms put in place by the hospital to provide the requested remedies.  The court observed that the issues raised could be dealt with administratively using existing avenues. The judge noted that the complainant had not demonstrated whether said mechanisms had been applied. Mr Bilkhu had petitioned the High Court to have the hospital's secretary-general removed from office.  But the judge said there was no evidence of alleged administrative misconduct by the secretary-general that had led to the loss of funds.  “The case was dismissed as there is no one and nothing to investigate; no one came forth to complain," said Surinder Singh Sihra, the vice-president of the East African Ramgarhia Board (EARB).  Sihra assured the public that the hospital is operational and that patients are being attended to smoothly every day.  “There is absolutely nothing to worry about, the facility is sound and keeps attending to the wananchi, who are the biggest beneficiaries of our services,” said Sihra.  The hospital is owned by EARB, a religious society that the Sikh community has used to run several social responsibility projects since 1985.    By Kamau Muthoni | 1 hour ago By Samson Wire | 2 hours ago By Lilian Chepkoech | 13 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago
