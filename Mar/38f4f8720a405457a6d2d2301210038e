The grave of a nine-year-old boy in Kisumu East where a 'resurrection attempt' was made on Sunday. [Washington Onyango, Standard]  Police officers in Kisumu East have foiled an attempt by a couple to exhume the body of their nine-year-old son. They hoped he would resurrect.  In an incident that has left neighbours surprised, Mr Okoth Obudo believed a spiritual leader who told him his son who was buried four months ago would come back to life.  It started after the Roho Musalaba church of the Legio Maria sect elder told Mr Obudo he had foreseen the boy’s resurrection.  The spiritual leader told the couple that the boy would resurrect on Sunday night. The church members had helped the couple together with other family members to dig up the boy’s body.

Neighbour Maureen Adhiambo said the couple believed their son was still alive. She was among a group of villagers who had gathered to witness the incident.  A team of officers from Kasagam raided the home and found the family digging.  Area OCPD James Musyimi confirmed the incident, saying the couple has been summoned for questioning.   “The family was found having dug the grave halfway and was stopped immediately,” he said.  According to a police report seen by The Standard, Mr Obudo defended himself saying he was following the church leader’s instruction.
