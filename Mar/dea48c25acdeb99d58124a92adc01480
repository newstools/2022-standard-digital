[Courtesy, Al-Jazeera]  A China Eastern Airlines aircraft that crashed on Monday, March 21, 2022, in southern China added to the list of Boeing planes that have, in the recent past, been involved in accidents.  The aircraft (Boeing 737-800), had 123 passengers and nine crew members on board and was due to land in Guangzhou on the east coast.  The aircraft, however, was a different version from Boeing's 737 Max, which has been on the spot for safety concerns.  In a statement, Boeing said: "Our thoughts are with the passengers and crew of China Eastern Airlines Flight MU 5735. We are working with our airline customers and are ready to support them. "Boeing is in contact with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.”  Priding itself as the world's largest aerospace company, Boeing has been on the spot after several of its planes were involved in accidents over the recent years.
