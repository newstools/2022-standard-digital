Safaricom is looking to partner with more than 100 businesses and organisations to provide their services and products as apps within the Super App.  These include all county services in the country, other government agencies, eCitizen, supermarkets and restaurants.  The M-Pesa Super App was launched in June 2021 and has had more than five million downloads in Kenya.     By Peter Theuri | 2 hours ago By Patrick Alushula | 2 hours ago By Macharia Kamau | 2 hours ago By Frankline Sunday | 2 hours ago
