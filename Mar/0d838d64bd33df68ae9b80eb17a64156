[Courtesy]  Three witnesses yesterday testified before a court in Eldoret in a case where a man is accused of defiling his 13-year-old stepdaughter.  They told Principal Magistrate Mogire Onkoba the girl lived with her step-father after her mother travelled to Saudi Arabia for work. “My stepfather first defiled me in 2018 while in Standard Three.”  Matters got worse when her mother travelled to Saudi Arabia early last year to work.  “My mother left me and my younger sister in his hands. I reported the matter to my mum on the phone, but nothing changed. I also reported the matter to the landlord, but he never helped me,” the girl said. After her complaints were ignored, she opted to run away from home. On October 11, 2021, after coming from school she escaped to a neighbour’s home at around 8pm where she was taken to the area chief.   Assistant chief Celestine Asige said she recorded the girl’s statements and let her spend the night at her house. The following day the girl was escorted to the police station where she recorded a statement and the suspect was traced.  “They were both escorted to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital for examination,” Ms Asige added.  The examination report presented in court showed the girl had been defiled. The man had been granted a Sh200,000 bond but it was cancelled after it was established the title deed produced in court had been used in a different case.   The hearing continues on May 2.
