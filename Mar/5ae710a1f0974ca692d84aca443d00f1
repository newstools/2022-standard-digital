In an incident that left traders along the busy Obote Road stunned, two robbers armed with an AK-47 rifle raided Jubilee Steel Hardware around midday.  They packed their getaway motorcycle next to the entrance and walked like normal customers into the business premises as one suspiciously clutched a bag.  Moments later, one of the robbers brandished a rifle he had concealed in the bag, cocked it and started backing orders to the staff to hand them money. The incident which was captured on the facility’s CCTV cameras shows one of the suspects climbing over the counters and searching frantically for money as terrified staff hid behind the counters.  The visibly frustrated robber who failed to find anything dashed for the door moments later before they fled the scene on a bodaboda.  The video of the incident has been shared across a number of platforms with Kenyans mocking their flopped robbery attempt.  Nyanza Region Police Commander Karanja Muiruri confirmed the incident and said they have launched a manhunt for the suspects.  A staffer of the enterprise, whom they suspect could have colluded with the suspects was detained by detectives as police continued with their probe on the incident.  “We have arrested one suspect and are looking for the two robbers,” he said.  No money was lost during the incident.  One of the robbers was clad in bodaboda riding gear, including a reflector and a helmet.
