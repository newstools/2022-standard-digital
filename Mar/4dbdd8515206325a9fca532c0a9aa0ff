[Kelvin Karani, Standard]  The Kenya Government Workers Union, Mombasa Branch yesterday gave county government one week to pay their February salaries or members would go on strike.  The union also gave Governor Hassan Joho’s administration a week to remit January and February deductions.  The workers’ union notice comes even as the County health workers’ strike enters its third day over delayed salaries and non-remittance of statutory deductions.  The Union’s secretary Mr Haji Mwinyi Kibwana said the county should meet their demands in a week’s time failure to which they will withdraw services. “If by next week the county will not have paid and remitted statutory deductions, then we will be forced to do what is good for us,” said Mr Kibwana.  Mr Kibwana said some of the workers had already received the January salaries but some are still waiting.  “Starting yesterday, the workers started receiving their salaries but those paid through certain banks are yet to receive theirs,” said Mr Kibwana.       By Joackim Bwana | 1 day ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 1 day ago By Patrick Beja | 1 day ago By Joackim Bwana | 2 days ago
