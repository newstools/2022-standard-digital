Vihiga County officials at Kakamega Law Courts yesterday. [Benjamin Sakwa, Standard]  Six senior Vihiga County officials facing corruption charges will take plea on Monday next week. They were expected to be charged yesterday in Kakamega but the court meant to hear the matter was not sitting.  They applied to be charged on a different date, a prayer that was granted by Kakamega Senior Principal Magistrate Dolphina Alego.  Through their lawyer Sam Onyango, they asked the court to defer their plea to a date when the court will be sitting.  “We suggest that our plea be moved to another date when the legally gazetted court that deals with EACC matters will be sitting.”   By Nathan Ochunge | 1 day ago By Brian Kisanji | 2 days ago By Alexander Chagema | 2 days ago By Juliet Omelo | 3 days ago
