NTSA in conjunction with Los Ninos launched a road safety training session at Kimorori primary school, Kenol, Murang'a to equip the learners with highway codes knowledge. [Boniface Gikandi, Standard]  National Transport Safety Authority (NTSA) has embarked on road safety education in primary schools to promote the safety of learners.  Yesterday, the roads agency introduced road safety tips at Kimorori Primary School following an outcry from residents after hundreds of pedestrians at the Makuyu and Kenol stretch were hit by runaway vehicles.  In the past two weeks, NTSA officials and partners have been taking learners through road signs and safety measures that include crossing major highways.  NTSA Director General George Njao said they were partnering with other players pertaining to the safety of learners in schools located along the highways. He said 'Los Ninos' was a leading partner on safety education in schools, towards the reduction of road accidents.  “We aim to roll out the safety programme to more than 1,000 schools on the highways following rising road accidents, "said Njao.  He said the agency was holding talks with Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) over the construction of a footbridge to serve the fast-growing Kenol market.  Njao said road safety was a community issue calling for collaboration with partners to ensure the safety of children and pedestrians.  Kimorori school exercise was a pilot programme ahead of a project to be rolled out countrywide.  Los Ninos initiative representative Angela Kang’ethe said they embarked on the concept to promote the safety of learners through training traffic marshals.  “The vuka salama initiative involved interactive training traffic marshals and provision of safety materials among others,” said Kang’ethe.   By James Munyeki | 1 hour ago By Caroline Chebet | 1 hour ago By Philip Mwakio | 1 hour ago By Lydiah Nyawira | 1 hour ago
