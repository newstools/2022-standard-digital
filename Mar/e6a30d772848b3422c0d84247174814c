Amelia Jacobeth, an inmate at Kakamega women's celebrates together with the prison warden after the release of KCPE results on Monday. Jacobeth scored 402 marks. [Benjamin Sakwa, Standard]  Standing at 5 feet 8 inches tall with a chubby face hiding her dark prison experience, Amelia Jacobeth is proud of her 402 marks in the 2021 KCPE exam.  Her present, she hopes her family will visit her at Kakamega prison. The 31-year-old first sat the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in 2007 and managed 305 marks.  Ms Jacobeth says the decision to re-sit the exam was a step in the journey to reconnect with her family. “I have been in Kakamega Prison remand since January last year. No close family member has visited since then.  "It hurt my mental health and I found solace in education,” she said. Ms Jacobeth said as her case continues, she will continue with her secondary education after having dropped out of Eregi Girls Secondary in Form Three. There are avenues of online learning in prison that she says will help her attain the highest level of education.  Ms Jacobeth was charged with killing her mother Leonida Benadena, a pastor, on January 12 last year in Shisembe village, Kakamega South. She chooses not to recall the experience".  Doreen Anabaka, the Kakamega Women’s Prison in charge, said she didn’t expect a prison candidate to score more than 400 marks. The majority score an average of 250.       By Juliet Omelo | 9 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 2 days ago By Omelo Juliet | 3 days ago By Robert Amalemba | 4 days ago
