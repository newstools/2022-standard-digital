Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the Azimio la Umoja brigade will today traverse Nakuru County in a fresh vote hunt ahead of the August elections.  This will be Raila’s first rally since he was last Saturday endorsed by ODM and President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party at their respective delegates conferences. Inside sources say Raila will later this week tour Kisii, Nyamira, Machakos, Bungoma and Busia counties.  Nakuru County ODM chair Bernard Miruka said all was set for the meet-the-people tour by Raila and other national figures. “We urge residents to turn up in large numbers in Molo, Elburgon, Njoro and Nakuru to solidify support for Raila’s presidential bid,” said Mr Miruka.  He said the rally was open to all under the Azimio la Umoja movement. “We pride in the diversity of our county. We have supporters of the various political parties in Nakuru and all are welcome to show solidarity with Raila and listen to his policies,” said Miruka.   Raila launched Azimio la Umoja roadmap in Nakuru in August 2021 before taking it to the rest of the counties. He has also made several other visits to the county this year.  Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui and his Laikipia's Ndiritu Muriithi are among the leaders expected to accompany Raila in his Nakuru forays.  Separately, Kinyanjui, who started Ubuntu People’s Forum party, which supports Raila's presidential bid, welcomed the ODM leader to Nakuru. “Our people are peace-loving and welcoming to all. We shall be part of the campaigns and root for support of the Ubuntu spirit. Nakuru must be part of the national conversation,” said Kinyanjui.  Elders in the county, led by Waweru Ng’ang’a, who flanked the Nakuru ODM chairperson urged leaders who will accompany the former Prime Minister to ensure they preach peace during the campaigns.
