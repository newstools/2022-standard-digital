Guyder Oruru, candidate at A.H.P Workshop Primary School emerged top with 418 marks. [Betty Njeru, Standard]  Guyder Oruru Okindo would like to be a politician, or fashion designer after completing his tertiary education.  Unlike his peers who opt for the traditionally lucrative courses, Oruru wants to be a politician so that he can help others.  “I want to be a politician, author, and own my own fashion line one day,” he told The Standard.  The 14-year old emerged the top candidate at A.H.P Workshop in Belgut, Kericho County, scoring 418 marks out of the possible 500. Oruru said he wasn’t expecting to emerge top of his class at the A.H.P Workshop Primary School.  “I was just checking the results targeting 380 marks and above. I didn’t expect to be a top performer,” he said.  Although he faced minimal challenges getting to school, he is grateful for the support he received from his parents, who engage in menial work for survival.  His father, Deplin Okindo, said he’s proud of his son’s achievements, and cannot wait to see him unlock his potential.  “The school he joined had stiff competition. He only caught up in the second term, but he’s surprised us all,” Okindo said.  Oruru, who attended a public day school in Kericho County, was not always top of his class but triumphed in the 2021 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE).   The pupil, who was Index Number One, wants to join the Nairobi School.  At least 11,857 candidates scored 400 marks and above in last year’s exam, and some 315,275 pupils scored between 300-399 marks.
