Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi. [File, Standard]  A coalition of three fringe political parties was yesterday unveiled at the Coast days after Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi led Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) in signing a cooperation agreement with Jubilee Party in Nairobi.  Kadu Asili, Shirikisho Party of Kenya (SPK) and Umoja Summit Party of Kenya (USPK) leaders unveiled Ukombozi Wa Majimbo and said they were free to join Azimio la Umoja, Kenya Kwanza or operate as a single entity.  Speaking at a Mombasa hotel, leaders of the three parties said they were consulting with Coast residents ahead of elections.  They said they did not recognise the cooperation agreement between PAA and Jubilee Party, claiming theirs was the only entity that represented the coastal region. USPK chair Matano Chengo said they would champion unity of the region and address issues such as historical injustices on land, unemployment and declining economy.  “We have come together under Ukombozi wa Majimbo to champion issues of this region and are ready to work with like-minded parties,” Chengo said.    Kadu Asili national chair Joshua Kombora said they had settled on the new outfit as an original political ideology used to push for locals' interests. “It is not too late to come up with a coalition to unite the Coast. We will consult widely as we seek to work with other political formations,” he said.  Shirikisho member and former Tourism Minister Morris Dzoro said they had been consulting other political parties for the past two years and had finally given the region political direction.  “We have been discussing the formation of this coalition for the last two years and we are happy,” Dzoro said.
